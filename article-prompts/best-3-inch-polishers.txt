When installing an eccentric shaft for use with this machine, vibrations may be more noticeable compared to a rotary polisher. However, the vibration value of 10.976 m/s\u00b2 is also within normal operating parameters. We appreciate your understanding. Based on our testing, after approximately 10 minutes of continuous no-load operation, the machine's temperature will reach around 37\u00b0C. This is a normal heating phenomenon. It does not affect the machine's performance and poses no safety hazards to personnel."
