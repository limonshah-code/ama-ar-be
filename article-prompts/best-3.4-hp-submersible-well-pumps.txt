      "Upgraded Stainless Steel: The whole frame of our deep well pump is unlike anything on the market. It is made of stainless steel, including the outlet and connecting components. You don't have to worry about it becoming rusted or corroded after being underwater for a long time. With ETL certification and IP68 waterproof grade, the pump can be used for 8-10 years.
