Just pull the trigger and let the motor spin the fasteners, helping you finish jobs faster and with far less effort than a manual ratchet, while its compact size stores easily in your toolbox, drawer, or trunk.",

Simply swap packs to keep the ratchet running through longer repair or assembly jobs. The AIDERAR ratchet also features a Makita-style battery interface, allowing you to use many existing 18V Makita-series batteries you already own (where compatible) for even more runtime and flexibility.",

For stubborn bolts and nuts, first break them loose manually, then pull the trigger to let the motor quickly spin the fastener off, reducing strain while protecting the tool and the fastener. The convenient forward/reverse switch makes direction changes quick and easy during continuous work.",

Standard 3/8\" square drive plus included 1/4\" and 1/2\" adapters fit most sockets and bits, making this ratchet a versatile choice for automotive repair, home maintenance, and DIY projects.",

Loosening often needs much higher breakaway torque, so for large, rusted, or impact-tightened fasteners, first crack them loose with a hand ratchet or breaker bar, then use the cordless ratchet to spin them off."
