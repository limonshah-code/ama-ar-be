      "Extend the lifespan of your TV: The motherboard is the core component of the TV, and its malfunction can affect the normal operation of other components, and even accelerate their aging. Replacing the motherboard with a new one ensures the coordinated operation of all the TV's components, reduces damage to other parts caused by motherboard issues, and thereby extends the overall lifespan of the TV, saving you the cost of replacing the entire TV.",
      "Fix compatibility issues: During use, the TV may encounter incompatibilities with certain external devices (such as set-top boxes, game consoles, audio systems, etc.), such as failure to recognize the device or issues with picture and sound synchronization. Replacing the motherboard may resolve these compatibility issues, allowing the TV to work seamlessly with various external devices and expanding its functionality.",
      "Enhance Audio Effects: If the motherboard has issues, the TV's audio output may be affected, resulting in noise, fluctuating volume, and other problems. Replacing the motherboard can ensure stable audio signal transmission, allowing you to enjoy purer, clearer, and more immersive sound, as if you were in a cinema.",
      "Improve system smoothness: An aging motherboard can cause the TV system to run sluggishly, with slow responses when switching channels or opening apps.
