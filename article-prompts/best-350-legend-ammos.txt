      "NO-GO: Corresponds to the maximum headspace we recommend for gunsmiths\u2019 chambering new bolt-action rifles. This is not a SAAMI-maximum measurement. If a rifle closes on a NO-GO Gauge, it may still be within SAAMI specifications, or it may have excessive headspace. To determine if there is excessive headspace, the chamber should then be checked with a FIELD Gauge. The NO-GO Gauge is a valuable tool for gunsmiths\u2019 reaming new chambers, in order to ensure tight and accurate headspace",
