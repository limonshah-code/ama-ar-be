      "HEAVY-DUTY 4\u00d736 BELTS FOR BIG FLAT JOBS \u2013 Flooring refinishers, cabinet shops and serious DIYers need a belt that can level wide boards, tabletops and doors without stalling the project. These 4\u00d736 in sanding belts are tuned for heavy-duty stock removal in woodworking, helping you strip old finishes, flatten panels and true edges fast so large jobs move forward instead of getting stuck on slow, underpowered abrasives.",
      "HEAT-RESISTANT RESIN BOND FOR COOLER, LONGER CUTTING \u2013 Big flat runs build friction fast; ordinary belts glaze over, lose bite and start leaving shiny burn marks. These 4\u00d736 in belts use a heat-resistant resin-over-resin bond that keeps the aluminum oxide grains locked in place under high pressure, allowing them to keep cutting clean instead of smearing. The bond and open-coat structure help the belt run cooler, shed dust efficiently and maintain a consistent cut rate over more passes, so each belt delivers more usable life before you need to swap it out.",
      "LESS REWORK, LESS WASTE, EASIER CUSTOMER APPROVAL \u2013 When a belt runs hot or tracks poorly, you pay for it twice: once in wasted material and once in time spent fixing flaws. Backed up by the heavy X-weight cloth backing and a precision butt joint, these belts stay flat and stable on your 4\u00d736 benchtop sander instead of jumping at the seam or wandering off the platen. That means fewer burnt spots to scrape out, fewer wave marks telegraphing through stain, and fewer high-value boards or stair treads you have to scrap\u2014so jobs reach final sanding and customer sign-off with far less stress.",
      "80\u2013400 GRIT RANGE FOR WOOD, METAL, PAINT & PLASTICS \u2013 One 12-pack handles the full path from aggressive stock removal to pre-finish sanding across multiple materials. Use 80 and 120 grits to knock down high spots, welds, rust and thick paint on mild steel, hardware and fixtures, or to flatten hardwood floors and panels; step to 150 to refine grinder and sander marks; finish with 240 and 400 to smooth edges and profiles on wood, primed surfaces, plastics and composites before stain, repainting or clear coat. From woodworking and furniture repair to metal fabrication, paint prep and plastic shaping, you stay on one predictable grit ladder instead of juggling different belts.",
      "BUILT TO ANSWER REAL SHOP QUESTIONS ABOUT DURABILITY & MATERIALS \u2013 Woodworkers constantly ask if belts will hold up, run cool and stay effective on demanding 4\u00d736 sanding jobs. These sanding belts use precision-coated aluminum oxide on an open-coat, anti-clog structure to resist loading, stay sharp and shed dust, while the reinforced bond and seam protect against premature failure under heat and pressure. That means fewer interruptions, fewer ruined parts and more confidence every time you power up your 4\u00d736 benchtop belt sander."
