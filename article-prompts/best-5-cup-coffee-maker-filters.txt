The five-cup coffee filter paper is thicker than regular filter paper to minimize coffee grounds from getting into your coffee, and it stands up to the hot water passing through and don\u2019t collapse under the heat and/or pressure of the water.

High sides prevent grounds to get into your coffee. Work perfectly in most 1-4 cup electric drip coffee makers and basket-style holders such as the Mr Coffee coffeemaker, black and decker single serve coffee maker, Ninja coffeemaker, Ninja PB041ST coffee maker, Ninja PB051 Single cup, scoop coffee maker and more single serve coffee pot."
