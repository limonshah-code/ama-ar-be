That's a huge leap from old-school, knob-controlled heaters. With its user-friendly thermostat displaying current and desired temperatures, operating this heater is a breeze.",
      "SAFETY FIRST - Overheating and dry run protection got you covered. If the water dips below the minimum required level, the heater switches off (DRY RUN PROTECTION). It also powers down if the water temperature surpasses 97F (OVERHEATING PROTECTION), so you don't have to worry about inadvertently \"cooking fish\"!",
      "MEMORY FUNCTION - Last settings are stored in the thermostat's chip. In case of power loss, the aquarium heater resumes operation based on the last recorded setting upon power restoration.",
      "PROTECTIVE HOUSING - Our fish tank heater is equipped with a protective casing, ensuring the warmth disperses without risks of glass damage and potential burning hazards to the fish from the surrounding heat of the heater. This removable enclosure is a breeze to clean, aiding in the prevention of grime and limescale accumulation. It supports a temperature spectrum from 64F to 93F.",
      "VERSATILE APPLICATIONS - This heater isn't solely designed for aquariums. It's perfectly compatible with both fresh and saltwater environments. Beyond functioning as a standard fish heater, it can double up as a turtle heater, pet fountain heater, or a plant seedling heater."
