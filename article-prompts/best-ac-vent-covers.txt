      "The size that you need to know to buy this vent cover, or any other vent cover is by measuring the air duct opening (the plenum box opening) and not the face size or the vent cover. We recommend you remove the old air vent cover and measure the size of the air duct opening. You do not need to take into consideration the face size of the vent cover. The important measurement is the interior duct opening size. Example: A traditional vent cover size can have a face size of 14x8, and neck of a little less than a 12x6. Your air duct opening should measure 12x6, so you purchase a 12x6. Vent cover dimensions are categorized by the neck and not by the face of the air vent cover.",
      "The method of installation of our modern air ac vent cover is hidden through the pre-drilled holes inside of the diffuser, which can be accessed by opening the dampers and using a drill with a six-inch extension to screw it into place. Please find attached our instructional videos. This way we avoid having a front drill screw and ruin the esthetics of the product."
