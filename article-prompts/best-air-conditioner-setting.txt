    "features": [
      "4 Dynamic Modes: Seamlessly cycle through Cool, Dry, Fan, & Auto modes with the touch of a button. Cool Mode transforms your space by cooling and simultaneously reducing humidity. Embrace Dry Mode by reducing air humidity triggering an automatic cycle of cooling and air fan functions. Transition to Fan Mode for a gentle breeze, and in Auto Mode, let the unit select the mode (Cool, Dry, or Fan) based on room temperature. The automatic temperature adjustment, influenced by the seven sensors in the indoor unit, ensures a consistent climate.",
      "Sleep Function: Press the SLEEP button and all the display lights will turn off after a while, but the Sleep light is always on. In SLEEP mode, the air conditioner will automatically adjust the temperature and fan speed to make the room more comfortable during the night. The set temperature will automatically raise every 30-60 minutes, and at most change six times until the set temperature is 81 or 82 . When the timer is not in use, the operation mode and the set temperature will be displayed. Time will be displayed under the timer setting.",
      "Eco Friendly: When the unit is in ECO mode, the light will turn on. In ECO mode, the unit will turn off once the room is cooled to the user-set temperature. The unit will turn back on when the room temperature rises above the user-set temperature. Before the compressor starts, the fan motor will run for a while, then it will stop for a while, and will repeat to provide a much more comfortable feeling and save energy. After the fan motor works for 500 total hours, the Filter Check light will turn on to remind the user to clean the filter.",
      "Remote Control: Enjoy ultimate convenience with the included remote control for your air conditioner, granting you the power to manage modes, fan speed, eco settings, timer functions, and more\u2014all from the comfort of your couch or bed. The intuitive display button enables you to toggle all lights or the LED display on/off, promoting restful relaxation. Experience the epitome of ease as you customize your climate control preferences with precision and indulge in the luxury of seamless, remote-operated comfort at your fingertips.",
      "Air Filter Cleaning: The air filter should be checked once per month to see if it needs cleaning. Trapped particles and dust can build up in the filter and may decrease airflow as well as cause the cooling coils to accumulate frost. To clean the air filter remove the filter by sliding it out from the right side of the air conditioner. Gently wash the filter using liquid dish soap and warm water. Shake to remove excess water and let dry. If you wish to avoid washing the filter you can simply remove it, vacuum the filter and replace."
