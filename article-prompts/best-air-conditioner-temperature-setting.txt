      "Adjustable Thermostat: This window air conditioner features 7 temperature settings, allowing you to customize your cooling experience. Simply turn the dial to 7 for maximum air flow and the coldest setting, or adjust it to a lower number for a milder breeze and energy efficiency. Perfect for maintaining a comfortable indoor climate, whether you need a quick cool-down or steady temperature control throughout the day.",
      "Washable Filter: Designed for easy maintenance, our mechanical 5,000 BTU room air conditioner includes a washable filter to help keep the air clean and fresh. For optimal performance, check the air filter once per month to ensure efficient operation and airflow. To clean, remove the filter from the right side of the air conditioner, then wash it using liquid soap and warm water. After thoroughly drying the filter, reinsert it securely to maintain peak cooling efficiency and extend the life of your unit. Regular cleaning helps improve air quality and keeps your air conditioner running smoothly.",
      "Power Failure Recovery: If a power failure occurs, rest assured that your air conditioner will automatically restart once power is restored, ensuring continuous comfort without the need for manual intervention. However, the unit is equipped with a built-in safety time delay, meaning it may take up to 3 minutes before cooling resumes to protect the internal components. After a power outage, always check the interrupter switch on the power cord and ensure it is reset before operation. This safety feature helps prevent electrical overload and ensures the longevity of your air conditioner.",
      "Window Installation: This air conditioner is specifically designed for easy installation in a standard double-hung window with a width between 23\" and 34\". For added flexibility, it can also be installed without the accordion panels to fit into a narrower window opening if needed. To ensure proper ventilation and secure placement, the window must have a minimum vertical clearance of 14.5\". Carefully follow the installation instructions to ensure a tight, stable fit, preventing air leaks and maximizing cooling efficiency. Proper installation not only enhances performance but also helps maintain energy efficiency and safety.",
      "Directional Louvers & Customizable Airflow: This air conditioner is designed for optimal cooling control with adjustable directional louvers, allowing you to customize airflow for targeted comfort. It also features dual speed settings for both cooling and fan-only modes, giving you the flexibility to choose between powerful cooling or gentle air circulation. To easily direct the airflow where you need it most, simply roll the scroll wheel in a vertical direction to adjust the louvers. Whether you want a steady breeze across the room or concentrated cooling in one area, these adjustable settings ensure personalized comfort for any space."
