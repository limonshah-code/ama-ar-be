      "\"Typhur has designed a future where every meal can be mastered, and every cook can have the power of precision in their hands.\" - USA Today",
      "World\u2019s First Oven with Built-in Wireless Probe: Cook with precision at home using the first air fryer oven with a built-in wireless probe. Tracks core temperature in real time and automatically stops at your desired doneness. Smart Remove-Temp auto-shutoff prevents overcooking and a built-in signal booster keeps readings stable through light foil. No wires, no pairing, no guessing",
      "Smart Air Fryer-Toaster Combo: Cook meats perfectly with the Typhur Sync Oven. A NIST-verified wireless probe with five sensors delivers \u00b10.5\u00b0F accuracy. Use Beef, Fish, Pork, Lamb, or Poultry presets or set a custom target. Monitor temps, track remaining cook time, and control cooking via the Typhur app for stress-free results",
      "360\u00b0 Turbo Convection System: Air fry wings, fries, or veggies with minimal oil for a golden, crispy exterior while keeping the inside tender and juicy. Dual heating elements and a 2400 RPM fan circulate heat in a full 360\u00b0 for faster, more even cooking, roasting dishes up to 30% quicker than traditional ovens. Perfect for healthier, chef-quality results",
      "12-in-1 Cooking Versatility: With a wide temperature range of 85\u2013450\u2109 and 3 fan speeds, the oven offers 12 cooking modes (Roast, Bake, Air Fry, Broil, Pizza, Cookies, Toast, Bagel, Proof, Reheat, Dehydrate, Keep Warm) and 5 probe presets (Beef, Fish, Pork, Lamb, Poultry). Access approximately 35 step-by-step app recipes plus 15 printed recipes, with app recipes continuously updated for inspiration and guidance",
      "App Control and Easy Cleanup: Monitor real-time temperatures, adjust cooking time, and receive done alerts directly via the Typhur app. The app also lets you manage multi-stage cooking, view oven and probe status. Accessories including the air fryer basket, wire rack, roasting pan, crumb tray, and wireless probe are dishwasher-safe. The 27\u202fQT family-sized oven fits a 12-inch pizza, a 6\u202flb whole chicken, 6 slices of toast, or 2\u202flb of fries",
      "Magnetic Probe Storage and Ultra-Fast Charging: A magnetic probe dock stores and charges the probe on the oven during standby. Super-fast charging powers a full cook in approximately 3 minutes, and a full charge supports multiple cooks for hands-off convenience",
      "Note: For proper ventilation, allow at least 4\u2033 (10\u202fcm) of clearance around the oven. A countertop depth of at least 16.4\u2033 is recommended, including this clearance. When using the roast pan on the lowest rack at 450\u00b0F, the temperature may exceed this due to the heating element. For safety, we recommend using heat-resistant silicone gloves instead of fabric mitts"
