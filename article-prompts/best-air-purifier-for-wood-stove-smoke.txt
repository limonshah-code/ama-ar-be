Our 3.5 watt quartz glass bulb is over 600% more effective than single LED-led solutions resulting in a ZERO OZONE verified product that releases cleaner, fresher air back into the room",
      "INTELLISENSE AIR QUALITY INDICATOR: measures the room air quality 60 times per minute using a PM 2.5 sensor detecting tiny particles in the air smaller than the diameter of a strand of human hair.
