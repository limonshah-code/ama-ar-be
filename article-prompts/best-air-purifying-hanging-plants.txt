Our dried eucalyptus bundles offer a unique home spa experience",

      "Tips: If the fragrance of eucalyptus fades and you don't care about the shape of the leaves, gently rolling the leaves with a mallet or bottle can release more fragrance. Eucalyptus contains glycerin, which is harmless to health and may ooze green liquid when it comes into contact with water. So, whether you hang eucalyptus in the bathroom or decorate it in a vase, there is no need to add water, and not touching water can keep eucalyptus for a longer time"
