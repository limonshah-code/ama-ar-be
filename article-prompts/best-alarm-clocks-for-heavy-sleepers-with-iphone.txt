      "SMALL BUT MIGHTY - If it takes an earthquake or siren to wake you up, this classically designed clock is exactly what you are looking for. The 3-level adjustable shaker is perfect for heavy sleeper or those with hearing loss. You also have the option to combine the vibration with the built-in alarm sound (buzzer, bird or music).",
      "EASY TO SETUP - Turning the two \u201cears\u201d to set the time and alarm is extremely intuitive and straightforward. With all buttons clearly labeled and almost no two functions sharing the same button, it is a breeze to use right out of the box and change settings.",
      "CUSTOMIZABLE ALARM - The brightness of the classic is dial-controlled and adjustable from 0 to 100%. Dual alarms satisfy the need of anyone who shares the bed with a partner on a different morning schedule. Snooze allows extra 9 minutes of slumber.",
      "USB PORTS AND BATTERY BACKUP - 1 USB port located at the back will charge your mobile device while you sleep. AC-powered, but you have the option to back it up with 2 AAA batteries (NOT included) in case of power outage. Not only time and settings are restored, but alarms are also supported (vibration and USB will not work).",
