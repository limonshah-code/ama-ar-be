      "#1 In France And Italy \u2192 With an incredible 88psi capacity, unique self-tightening seal and authentic Italian manufacturing, it\u2019s easy to see why top Champagne Bars across the world consider WAF Champagne Stoppers the only Professional Champagne Stopper worth using. While pressure pump bottle stoppers oxidize the taste of your bubbly, the WAF stopper keeps CO2 in the liquid. Fizzy, right to the last drop!",
      "How Does It Work!? \u2192 KLOVEO\u2019s sparkling wine stopper is smarter than your average stopper. The seal uses a simple but brilliant physics principle (Pascal's Law). As pressure builds inside the bottle, the plastic nipple expands outward, creating a \u2018bubble-tight\u2019 seal. Lay your bottle flat, or stand it upright and the seal works the same. BPA and Phthalate Free.",
      "Fits All Standard Bottle Necks \u2192 The shape of the bottle can be anything - if the neck is a standard 750ml Champagne or Sparkling Wine bottle neck (and we all know what that looks like), then this Champagne preserver will fit. It can be used for Prosecco, Cava, some Magnum and 187ml bottles, and many large format beer or cider bottles.",
      "Easy To Use \u2192 Unlike the outdated style of Champagne bottle stoppers (the exploding spring-loaded type), our WAF Champagne Saver is easy and fast. Simply press the cap down (the seal does the rest of the work for you), then lock with the stainless steel safety clip. It\u2019s easy to release, even with arthritic hands! And, the key to max fizz is to seal your bottle right away, and keep it ice cold.",
      "Made In Italy \u2192 Similar Champagne corks say they\u2019re Italian, but check the package and it\u2019s China! The WAF Champagne bottle stopper is patented by Italian inventor Walter Fortunato (WAF) and manufactured in Italy. It\u2019s the only stopper with a self-tightening seal, and easy release clip. And while some people tell us it provides the perfect fizz for up to two weeks, we say 3-5 days max. Try it now, and decide yourself!"
