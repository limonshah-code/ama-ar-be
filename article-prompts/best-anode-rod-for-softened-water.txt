      "THICK 3/4\" DIAMETER \u2013 Our anode rod for hot water heater has a 3/4\" thick diameter, providing more material to sacrifice than the 5/8\" diameter used by some competitors' products. A solid anode also provides even greater surface area for protection than a flexible anode rod.",
      "STANDARD 1-1/16\" SOCKET FOUND IN EACH BASIC SOCKET KITS\u202f- A 1-1/16\" socket and teflon sealing tape are required to remove the old anode from your water heater and install the new one. In the rare case that a 12-point socket starts to strip the anode, we suggest using a 6-point socket to prevent damage to the head and for easier removal and installation.",
      "LIFETIME WARRANTY \u2013 Benefit from a lifetime warranty on our water heater anode rod, ensuring it protects your water heater from corrosion throughout the anode's entire lifespan.",
      "PROUDLY AMERICAN SINCE 1996 \u2013 Trusted and reliable, our company has been providing top-quality water heater products to American households since 1996.",

Smith, Bosch, Giant, GWS, GE, John Wood, Kenmore, Reliance, Rheem, Richmond, Rinnai, RUUD, State, Whirlpool, U.S. Craftmaster, and more.",
      "REQUIRED 4 FEET CLEARANCE \u2013 If you don\u2019t have at least 4 feet above your water heater, we suggest you purchase a Water Connection\u2019s flexible anode rod for easier installation.",
      "DOES NOT FIT MOST BRADFORD WHITE AND HOT WATER OUTLET \u2013 For any water heater that does not have a designated anode slot on top of the unit (such as most Bradford White tanks), we suggest buying Water Connection\u2019s nipple anode rod to be installed in the hot water outlet.",
      "EXTEND YOUR WATER HEATER'S LIFE \u2013 The anode rod plays a crucial role in protecting your water heater from corrosion. By replacing it when it is 50% depleted, you can prevent hard water damage, extend your water heater's lifespan, and save time and money on repairs."
