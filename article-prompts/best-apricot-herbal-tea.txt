It\u2019s also important to note that not all of the caffeine can be fully removed from decaf teas; typically, a very small amount (such as 2-4 mgs/cup).",
      "STEEPING INSTRUCTIONS: Simply heat fresh, filtered water to a rolling boil. Then pour 6 oz of water over a tea bag and steep for 3-5 minutes. Remove the tea bag and enjoy Sip by Sip.
