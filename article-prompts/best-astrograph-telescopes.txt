      "Along with the more light coming into the astrograph, the limiting magnitude can reach 12.2.Askar 120APO adopts a triplet air-spaced APO lens design, including one piece of ED glass.",
      "The Askar 120APO has two finder bases, one on each side. Many users have some concerns about the limited space for installing additional astronomical accessories along the use. To address this, we have specially set finder bases on both sides of the focuser. This not only eliminates the need for disassembly when changing the position of the finder scope but also provides additional mounting positions for other astronomical accessories.",
      "The Askar 120APO has two optional accessories(now): a 1x flattener, and a 0.8x reducer. Both of them have built-in filter threads which allow direct filter mounting. Also, they have M54/M48 adapters which are convenient for attaching accessories.",
      "In terms of visual observations, the Askar 120APO pays great attention to observation quality. It can easily achieve focus when connected to 1.25\" or 2\" diagonals or various eyepieces. Because of the segmented lens tube design, it can also be attached to binoviewer for visual observation."

      "130PHQ is a long-focal-ratio, flatfield astrograph newly launched after 107PHQ. Instead of buying extra flatteners, calculating the backfocus of flattener or making tedious connection to match the distance, astrophotographers can simply equip it with any possible imaging devices, make the target stay at the focus, and then the whole optical system is perfect for imaging.",

      "130PHQ comes with a telescopic lens hood, a high quality CNC machined and painted tube and attractive decorative parts. The 3.4\" rigid focuser comes with M68, M54, and M48 adapters and a finder base. When used with the 3\" 0.7 x flat field reducer, the telescope can reach a focal ratio of f/5.4 and a focal length of 700mm, effectively reducing exposure time.",
