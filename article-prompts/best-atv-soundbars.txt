      "What is good about an ALUMINUM sound bar\uff1fIt is sturdy, more impact-resistant, better heat dissipation and better sound quality. Aluminum's high stiffness and density help reduce unwanted vibration and resonance, resulting in a clearer, cleaner sound output. At the same time, aluminum has good thermal conductivity, which helps keep internal components at a lower temperature during extended periods of operation, thus stabilizing the performance of the device and avoiding sound distortion or damage caused by overheating",
      "Low Frequency Radiator vs Subwoofer: First of all, the passive radiator does not generate any sound, not low frequencies, not full range frequencies. Passive radiator is not a speaker, it just reacts to the woofers vibrations. The Subwoofer is your ideal choice when you want to hear every note of a song come through loud and clear. It adds power and thickness to your sound system.
