The HBS2G fits most \"Selmer\" style Baritone saxophone mouthpieces. </p><p>H-Ligatures feature a four-point system, which applies equal pressure to the reed. The H-ligature holds the reed firmly to the table of the mouthpiece, assuring better contact, and therefore reducing leaks along the side rails. Additional support has been added to the ligature brackets to increase durability. H-ligatures feature a two-screw, inverted design. Each H-ligature includes Rico's unique mouthpiece cap. </p><p>Since the acquisition of Rico by D'Addario & Co., Rico has strengthened its position as the global leader in woodwind reeds and accessories. Rico's state-of-the-art reed research center in Southern California employs a collaboration of agronomists, scientists, and musicians to produce top-quality reeds, including Rico Reserve premium reeds for clarinet and saxophone. Rico reeds are designed to benefit all levels of musicians, from the beginner to the seasoned professional. Many of the world's finest woodwind players perform with Rico reeds, such as Mark Nuccio, Jerry Bergonzi, Chris Potter, Benny Golson, Ernie Watts, Bob Sheppard, Henri Bok, Richie Hawley, Eric Alexander, and many more.<p>",
