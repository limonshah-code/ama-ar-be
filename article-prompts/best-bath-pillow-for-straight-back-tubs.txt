Before the first use, rinse with soap and water is recommended as the product is packaged with the environment in mind without plastic bags.",

You can always adjust the placement of the suction cups to help the bath pillow stay in the desired area of the bathtub. WARNING! Avoid use of suction cups on uneven or textured surfaces."
