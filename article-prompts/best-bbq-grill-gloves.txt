      "\u3010Enhanced Heat Resistance\u3011Although our grilling gloves have excellent heat resistance, it should be noted that all heat-resistant materials have their limits. Our heat resistant gloves can hold for 10 seconds when the temperature reaches 800 degrees Celsius (1472 degrees Fahrenheit). Generally speaking, the higher the temperature of an object, the shorter the holding time. For example, you can safely hold a hot metal baking tray taken out of a 200 degree Fahrenheit oven for longer than holding a hot metal pizza tray taken out of a 500 degree Fahrenheit oven. But for your safety, please avoid direct contact with open flames and avoid prolonged exposure to high temperatures to prevent burns.",
