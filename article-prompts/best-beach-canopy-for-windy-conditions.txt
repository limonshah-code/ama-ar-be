And for those rare beach days when there is little or no wind, Enjoy the convenience of the No-Wind Support pegs allowing you to still use your ShadeSock untill the winds pick up.",

      "Dual Compartment Carry Bag: The durable canvas carry bag has two compartments to separate the canopy and frame parts. It's slightly oversized for easy packing and extra space for other beach essentials. Bag Size: 46.5 inches x 5.5 inches x 4 inches. Please note: ShadeSock will not fit into suitcase."
