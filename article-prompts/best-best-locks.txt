Fortified deadbolt and self-locking mechanism make it a challenging opponent and highly secure. Opening the lock cylinder requires a laser-cut encrypted four-sided key that cannot be duplicated. Includes 3 keys, a virtually pick-proof cylinder, and no master key. Rated #1 by the Good Housekeeping Institute",
      "A FORMIDABLE ADVERSARY IN COMBINATION WITH STRENGTH OF BRAKE PEDAL \u2013 Installation utilizes one of strongest parts of your vehicle, the high strength tensile steel construction of the brake or clutch pedal arm that is virtually impossible to cut. When properly installed, Autolock prevents the brake or clutch pedal from being depressed, rendering the vehicle inoperable and therefore undrivable because many cars and trucks require these pedals be depressed before the vehicle can be put into gear",

You simply slide the AutoLock over top of the brake or clutch pedal arm and down to the floor, place your foot on the peg and slowly pull up the retractable handle and it locks automatically. Important measurements to consider: Fits vehicles with a brake arm width of 3/4\" or less & a minimum distance of 4\u201d or more between vehicle\u2019s floorboard & bottom of brake arm",
      "DETERS THIEVES WITH WARNING COMPONENTS & EXTREMELY CONFINED ACCESS LOCATION - Made with a bright red protective coating to act as a high visibility deterrent, and includes a bright yellow steering wheel cover & decal that alert intruders the vehicle is secure. Located in the driver's side floorboard of the vehicle, Autolcok presents an extremely difficult area for thieves to work unseen since door typically needs to be open to sufficiently access area, leaving thieves vulnerable to discovery",
      "ADD HIGHER SECURITY THAN STEERING WHEEL LOCKS & ALARMS - While many Americans have an anti-theft device, car alarms are frequently set off by accident and therefore mostly ignored and popular bars/locks applied to the car's steering column can be easily removed once the plastic steering wheel is cut in half. The Unbreakable AutoLock secures essential brake pedal operation, is made of thick steel construction, a solid steel lock, and is impervious to drills and saws"
