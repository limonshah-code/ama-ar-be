      "ELECTRONIC DISPLAY & INTERFACE: Smart, interactive display with LED touch-sensitive buttons that don't require heavy pressing and conveniently illuminate in red and blue so you know when heating and chilling are underway. Indicator lights notify you when bottle is empty and also when self-cleaning is underway. Plus, there's a bright digital clock that offers time at a glance, arrows that make adjusting water temperatures easy, and a night light that ensures no-spill refills late at night",
      "TRI-TEMP WITH ADJUSTABLE HOT & COLD: Unlike other water dispensers, with the tri-temp Brio water dispenser for 5 gallons you can preset hot and cold water dispensing temperatures to brew the perfect cup of green tea or cater to cold-sensitive teeth. Includes a safety lock on hot water that requires 2 steps to dispense hot water, ensuring the whole family is safe from accidental dispensing. Safety lock immediately relocks when dispensing is complete. And enjoy a robust 1.2 liters per minute dispensing for both hot and cold water",
      "SELF-CLEANING OZONE: With just a quick press of a button, you can initiate a 90-minute internal self-cleaning process on your Brio water dispenser that uses ozone to reduce biofilm buildup and other accumulated impurities in dispenser\u2019s reservoirs and tubing, resulting in consistently delicious water. Ozone dissipates when cleaning is done and leaves no chemical taste or residue behind",
