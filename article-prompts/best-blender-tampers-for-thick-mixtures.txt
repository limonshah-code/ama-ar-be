But for older juicer LIDS with larger top openings, I took two plastic LIDS from a large cereal container, cut holes in the middle, and stacked them up to let the rammer pass through. Then I took out the detachable plastic part of the juicer's rubber cover and put the tamper on the cover above the blade. (make sure it doesn't touch the blade before using it.)",
