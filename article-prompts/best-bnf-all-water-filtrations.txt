      "3-Stage Filtration - The Purewell gravity water filter system adopts a composite filter technology, can reduce most contaminants. The black carbon filter has passed authoritative NSF/ANSI 42 certification, it employs a 0.01\u03bcm hollow fiber UF membrane, a silver ion membrane and an activated carbon block to reduce chlorine and intercept rust, sediment, organic matter and heavy metals, etc. This water filter system has also passed authoritative NSF/ANSI 372 certification.",
      "Smaller Filter Pore Size - The filter pore size of Purewell gravity water filter is 0.01 microns so that it can filter out 99.99% tiny materials from the water while other brands' filter pore size is only 0.2 microns. The smaller filter pore size, the higher filtering accuracy. What's more, Purewell water filter system can maintain the optimal flow rate (4 gallon/hour) while the filter pore size is smaller.",
      "Complete Accessory Set: The system not only provides safe water but also adds a touch of style to your home with its 304 food-grade stainless-steel housing. This ensures a sturdy and long-lasting structure. The 304 stainless steel spigot that comes with the system fits the chamber perfectly, preventing any leaks. Additionally, a non-slip stand is included to enhance the user experience. These accessories are included in the package, you don't have to spend extra money on additional accessories.",
      "Energy Saving - Relying on the principle of gravity filtration, no electricity is needed. The gravity water filter system is divided into upper and lower chambers. The upper chamber can be filled with unfiltered tap water, the lower chamber will get clean water after filtered. Because it does not require electricity, it can be used indoors and outdoors. NOTICE: When the bottom chamber is full of filtered water, please do not add tap water to the top chamber or it will leak out.",
      "Long Lifespan and Replaceable - The two carbon filters (black) can provide up to 6000 gallons drinking water, the service life of a single filter element is 3000 gallons (According to different water quality, the lifespan of the filter elements would be a little different). But for optimum performance, the filter elements should be replaced every 6 months. NOTICE: The filter element DOES NOT lower TDS value."
