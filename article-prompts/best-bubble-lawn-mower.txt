      "Bubble Lawn Mower Design: This bubble lawn mower combines bubble making with the \"pretend play\" of a lawn mower. While children are pushing the lawn mower, they can not only enjoy the dreamy fun brought by bubbles (just like being in a fairy - tale world of bubbles), but also stimulate their imagination and creativity through the role - playing of \"pretending to mow the lawn\", making outdoor activities full of interest.",
      "The bubble lawn mower has two power supply methods: plug - in (through a USB interface, which can be connected to various power devices such as mobile power supplies) and 4 AA (which need to be equipped by yourself). Whether in the courtyard with a power socket or outdoors (such as parks without power), it can be used at any time to meet the needs of different scenarios.",
      "Convenient filling method: The bubble liquid can be easily filled from the top, making the process simple and quick. Children can add bubble liquid by themselves, and parents can also easily replenish bubble liquid in time. The built-in 240ml large-capacity bubble bottle reduces the trouble of frequently adding bubble liquid, allowing children to play with bubbles continuously.",
      "Safe and reliable material: Safe, non-toxic plastic bubble lawn mower for kids. Durable design withstands daily play. Easy assembly with detachable handle for compact storage. The handle height is increased from 18 inches to 22 inches, suitable for children of different heights from 3 years old to hold easily.It is a toy that can accompany children for a long time.",
      "An Ideal Gift for Festivals:The bubble lawn mower is an ideal festival gift (such as Easter, birthday, Halloween, Christmas, etc.). It has bright colors, and the packaging is exquisite. As a gift for children, it can not only make children harvest joy, but also add a unique surprise in the festival atmosphere, which is a good choice to express care and blessings for children."
