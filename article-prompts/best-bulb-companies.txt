      "THE RED SPIDER LILY acts different from your other flowers. It puts on its foliage during the winter months to take in nutrients. Then it goes dormant for the summer. When the rains come in late summer/early fall, it will pop out of the ground and bloom within a few days. Then it will go dormant for a couple more months before it puts on new foliage during the winter to help prepare for the next year's bloom.",
      "ALSO KNOWN AS THE HURRICANE LILY OR SURPRISE LILY, the Lycoris radiata gets its name from the softball-size coral-red flowers that appear after the cooler temperatures and heavy rains (hurricane) in late summer or early fall and have long stamens resembling spider legs. The blooms will suddenly \"surprise\" you by popping out of the ground and blooming a couple of days after the rains where there didn't appear to be anything planted before.",
      "FOLIAGE NEEDS 6+ HOURS OF WINTER SUN every day to thrive and soak up plenty of sun energy and your red spider lily bulbs should be planted at a depth about 2-3 times the height of the bulb. You can plant them anytime but avoid planting during a hard freeze",
      "THE RED SPIDER LILY GROWS WELL IN ZONES 7-10 and is a hardy perennial that is drought and heat resistant, often lasting decades and they multiply with new bulb offsets quite readily, so your 10 bulbs will turn into many over the years",
      "THE RED SPIDER LILY BULBS often don't bloom the first year as they need 6-12 months in the ground before they bloom, but after that they will bloom every year. You are planting for the future."
