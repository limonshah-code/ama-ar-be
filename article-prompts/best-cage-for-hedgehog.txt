The top cover will also prevent other animals from invading and disturbing the cage, provide a beautiful living environment for small pets.",
      "Easy to Install: The installation of the guinea pig habitat is entirely manual and does not require tools. The one-motion hook design is more labor-saving than ordinary Velcro. It's more convenient to remove and clean/reinstall. When installing the guinea pig fence, you can use straps and buckles. After the fence is installed, you can turn the c&c grids upside down with the door facing down, place the liner on the guinea pig pen, and then turn it upside down to hang the hooks.",
      "High quality fence: Our guinea pig playpen is made of high-quality coated steel panel, and each panel has undergone strength testing to avoid being damaged by small pets. The distance between the fence wire is 0.7 inches, which will not trap small animals. Among the 12 panels, there is a panel with a door on, making it easy to manage the entry and exit of pets.",
      "Triple Reinforcement to Prevent Loosening: Black buckles, white buckles, and black straps are all used to connect each panel. Different accessories provide stability from the bottom to the top of the guinea pig enclosure. The installation method is very simple, a 5-year-old kid can operate it (with instructions included). 50 black straps can be reused in areas you think need reinforcement.",
      "Waterproof Mat: The guinea pig cage liner is made of 600D Oxford cloth on the outside and thickened PVC fabric on the inside. It adopts a waterproof and scratch resistant design, which lasts longer and can be washed all over the body. The height of the mat is appropriate, allowing guinea pigs to stand freely without climbing out, while also preventing garbage from falling out. Based on practical usage experience, we have thickened the bottom corner to increase its wear resistance."
