      "Multi-angle adjustment, free to lie down:The office chair supports a wide range of reclining adjustments from 90 to 155 degrees. It not only allows you to maintain an upright sitting posture while working but also enables you to flatten it to a nearly reclining position with just one click. It is very comfortable for a short nap or relaxation, meeting the needs of different scenarios.",
      "Thickened and widened handrails for easier support:It adopts a new thickened and widened armrest design, which conforms to the curve of the arm, effectively relieving the pressure on the elbow and shoulder. It is especially suitable for users with a larger body type. When sitting for a long time, the arm placement is more comfortable and it is easier to stand up",
      "Spring seat cushion + waist airbag, double support:The highly elastic spring seat cushion disperses the pressure on the buttocks and does not collapse even after prolonged sitting. The waist is equipped with an adjustable airbag, which can freely adjust the force of the lumbar support through the inflation volume, precisely supporting the lumbar vertebrae and reducing the fatigue of the waist.",
      "Heavy duty metal base + dual rubber wheels, stable and durable:The thickened heavy-duty iron foot stand has a stronger load-bearing capacity. Paired with the new anti-slip rubber wheels, it moves smoothly and noiselessly, while avoiding floor scratches. It offers dual guarantees of safety and stability, making it suitable for various office environments.",
      "Designed specifically for overweight people, spacious and comfortable:The seat structure has been widened and reinforced. The seat cushion, backrest and armrests have all been optimized for large-sized users, providing a more spacious sitting space. It is equipped with high-density sponge and breathable fabric, ensuring no stuffiness during long sitting and significantly enhancing comfort."
