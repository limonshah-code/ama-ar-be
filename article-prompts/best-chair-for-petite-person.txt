      "\u3010Why Choose Power Recliner Chair\u3011 Operating a manual recliner to retract the footrest and open the backrest proves challenging for aged people, females and teenagers who lack of strength. Conversely, our power recliner makes it easier for the user to lie down and get up, which could be the best choice for those who have limited strength. You can also adjust the chair to a comfortable position to relax your back and neck.",
      "\u3010Zero Wall Space Saving Recliner\u3011Zero wall recliner is better than wall hugger recliner for many reasons: When the backrest of our zero wall recliner is totally reclined, the chair base slides forward so the backrest doesn't hit the wall, thus, it can be placed only 1-2 inches from the wall. Suitable for various small spaces, like apartment, living room, bedroom, RV and home theater. If you are tall or have a large weight, please visit our store to select another larger chair.",
      "\u3010Decorate Your Small Spaces\u3011 You can do all sorts of things you want in this chair in a variety of different scenarios. For example, reading a book in your small living room, watching a movie in your home theater, or taking a nap in your compact motorhome. This little nice chair fits all kinds of small spaces perfectly. You can buy more of these chairs to make pairs and decorate your living spaces.",
      "\u3010Convenient Design\u3011 The remote control eliminates the hassle of touching the side buttons while lying in the recliner chair, which brings the user a lot of convenience. Two side pockets are also a great idea - they can hold small items like remote, mobile phone and magazine!",
      "\u3010Compact Size and Easy Assembly\u3011: The overall size of our zero wall power recliner is 25\"(W) x 36.6\"(D) x 39.4\"(H). You can enjoy the fun of a tool-free assembly by our Neioml recliner. Assembling this power recliner chair is really a breeze - just slide the backrest into the base and connect the power cords, then you can enjoy this chair happily! We also provide customers with easy-to-understand instructions and assembly video.",
