      "MOISTURE ABSORBER BOXES - MHTTEC moisture absorbers boxes adopt non-electric physical dehumidification method, through spherical calcium chloride particles and activated carbon particles, which can effectively remove peculiar odors while efficiently dehumidifying. In addition, the spherical calcium chloride particles have strong water absorption capacity, and the water generation speed in the catchment area is slow, which prolongs the service life of the moisture absorbers to a certain extent.",
      "UNIQUE DESIGN - The lower part of the MHTTEC moisture absorbers boxes are translucent boxes with the independent water catchment area and the water is firmly locked inside by using high-quality one-way moisture-permeable paper, and the entire water absorption process is clear at a glance.",
      "DEHUMIDIFICATION PROCESS - When MHTTEC moisture absorbers boxes are used, white calcium chloride quickly dissolves and gathers into a whole block, and small water droplets appear in the catchment area. As dehumidification progresses, the white particles gradually dissolve and disappear, and a large amount of water appears in the catchment area. However, activated carbon particles do not dissolve.",
