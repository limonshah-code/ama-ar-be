Broil, braise, bake or roast your favorite meals in the oven up to 500 Degree F.",
      "WHAT IS PORCELAIN ENAMEL ON CAST IRON. It is glass that becomes bonded to the cast iron at high temperatures. A particulate of glass, called frit, is applied to the cast iron vessel and then baked at temperatures between 1200 and 1400\u00b0 F. The glass frit melts and fuses to the cast iron, forming a bond. Porcelain enamel on cast iron is heat tolerant and impervious to water and other consumables.",
      "EASY TO COOK AND CLEAN: The porcelain enameled interior has a smooth finish that minimizes sticking, promotes caramelization and resists staining. Although enameled cast iron is dishwasher safe, hand washing with warm soapy water and a nylon scrub brush is recommended to keep your Dutch Oven in tip top shape",
      "HEAT RETENTION: The cast iron vessel has superior heat distribution and retention, evenly heating throughout both the bottom and sidewalls. The tightly fitting lid seals in moisture for scrumptious pot roast, stews or a large batch of beans. Our heat retention also reduces the amount of energy needed for cooking.",
      "FAMILY OWNED SINCE 1896: Lodge has been a trusted family-owned brand since 1896. Made with non-toxic, PFOA & PTFE-free materials, this enameled Dutch oven reflects Lodge\u2019s commitment to quality and environmental responsibility."
