      "Warm Tip\uff1aWhen used for the first time, the legs of the folding clothes rack need to be forcefully pulled apart. After multiple expansions and retractions, the stretching of the folding clothes rack will become smoother. The four legs of the clothes rack are made of multiple steel pipes. When installing the clothes rack, stretch each steel pipe to the maximum to avoid tilting due to different lengths of the four legs",
