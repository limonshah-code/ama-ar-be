      "\ud83d\udd04 VERSATILE COOKING: Two-sided hinged design allows for easy flipping to ensure golden brown waffles on both sides",
      "\ud83d\udcaa DURABLE CONSTRUCTION: Made from long-lasting cast iron that becomes naturally seasoned with use for a reliable non-stick surface. Though pre-seasoned with soybean oil, we strongly recommend re-seasoning at home for superior release. When stickiness appears or seasoning wears off, clean and dry the iron, rub on oil as above, then bake it upside down in a 400\u2013500\u00b0F oven for 1 hour (with a tray beneath). Let it cool inside the oven before handling. Repeat to build an even more durable, non-stick finish.",
      "\ud83d\udcd6 INCLUDES E-BOOK: Start cooking right away with the SIRCLES E-book. Scan our QR code printed on our manual and you will find incredible waffle recipes."
