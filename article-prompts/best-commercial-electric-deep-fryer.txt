      "\u3010Double Overheat Protection\u3011Safety is at the core of this fryer. This model is updated from the regular model and equipped with double overheat protections (temperature limiter and thermostat). The thermostat automatically stops heating when the desired temperature is reached. Once the oil cools, it reheats to maintain optimal frying conditions. And the temperature limiter works when the thermostat fails. Besides, the fry basket features Anti-scalding handles and non-slip foot pads. The well-matched lid prevents hot oil splashes.",

This feature allows you to customize the frying temperature and time based on the type of food, ensuring perfect results every time.",
      "\u3010Tips\u3011Since each heating element is 1700w, when two plugs are plugged into the same socket and working at the same time, the total power reaches 3400w, which will cause the single socket to be overloaded and unable to work, so it is recommended to plug the two plugs into two different sockets; In addition, please make sure that the oil tank has been filled with oil before heating, and do not dry burn it, which will cause damage to the machine and cause certain dangers."
