      "VERSATILE ATTACHMENTS: This stand mixer includes a stainless steel bowl and 3 specialized attachments: a dough hook, flat beater, and wire whip. The dough hook kneads and mixes heavy ingredients (e.g., bread, pizza dough, pie crust). The flat beater is for creaming butter/sugar, folding, and emulsifying (e.g., cake batter, cookie dough, frosting, mashed potatoes, meat filling, cheesecake filling). The wire whip primarily whisks light mixtures (e.g., cream, egg whites). These attachments meet diverse recipe needs",
      "POWERFUL COMMERCIAL-GRADE MIXING: Features a 20 QT large-capacity, durable, easy-clean stainless steel bowl, handling up to 13.22 lbs of dough for efficient baking. Its 1100 W powerful motor offers 3 speed settings (High/Medium/Low). A sturdy bowl lock secures the bowl firmly, even during high-speed operation or mixing thick batter, with lower noise levels (\u226476dB), freeing you to prepare other ingredients",
      "CONVENIENT OPERATION: Equipped with a durable metal lifting mechanism to easily raise/lower attachments for adding ingredients or cleaning. Important: If adding ingredients while operating, press the emergency stop button first. After adding, gently turn the button clockwise to resume mixing",
      "UPGRADED TIMER: Enhanced timer function includes the original 0-60 minute setting plus an end-of-cycle alert. A brief, distinct audible signal effectively notifies you without being intrusive",
      "COMPREHENSIVE SAFETY FEATURES: \u2460 Auto Safety Stop: Automatically stops if the splash guard is opened, preventing injury. \u2461 Overload Protection: Safeguards the motor, extending appliance life. \u2462 Splash Guard: Features a secure cover over areas prone to splattering to contain ingredients",
      "WIDE RANGE OF APPLICATIONS: This commercial heavy-duty blender isn't just a dough mixer; it also excels as a meat filling mixer, cream whipper, butter blender, and more. It is perfectly suited for restaurants, bakeries, pizzerias, cake shops, and even home kitchens requiring large-volume production needs",
