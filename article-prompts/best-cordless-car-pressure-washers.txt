      "Note 01: Regarding the water inside the pressure washer - This is actually a normal occurrence for all pressure washers on the market. Before shipping, every unit undergoes a mandatory pump test to ensure its functionality (e.g., checking for leaks and proper water flow). A small amount of residual water from this test is unavoidable, and it does not mean the product has been used.",
