      "PLEASE NOTE: Your kids sofa play set typically expands within 48 hours of unpacking. However,due to package compression,it may take 1-2 weeks to reach its optimal state. During this period,slight fabric wrinkles or uneven corners might appear,but these should gradually vanish as the foam settles. We recommend using the play set once it feels comfortable,as movement helps the foam regain its original shape."
