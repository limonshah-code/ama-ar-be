      "\u3010Large-Capacity Dehumidification for Homes up to 3500 sq.ft\u3011Designed for spacious homes and demanding humidity conditions, Aeocky Boreas delivers reliable, lab-tested performance. It removes up to 50 pints per day in hot, humid environments (95\u2109, 95% RH) and 38 pints per day in warm, damp basements (86\u2109, 80% RH). Suitable for bedrooms, bathrooms, offices, basements, and whole-home use.(Dehumidification capacity is not the same as water tank volume.)",
      "\u3010Energy Efficiency That Matters Over Time\u3011With higher energy efficiency than many less optimized models, Boreas can significantly reduce power consumption during continuous use. Based on 24/7 use, its efficiency advantage can translate to up to 50% less energy usage, helping save up to 276 in annual electricity costs. When choosing a dehumidifier, it\u2019s important to consider long-term electricity expenses along with performance and upfront cost.",
      "\u3010Designed for a Quieter Home Environment\u3011Boreas features an advanced sound-control structure with vibration isolation to reduce noise transfer. Its dual-chamber airflow layout helps smooth air movement and limit pulse noise. At the lowest fan setting, sound levels are as low as 40 dB, comparable to soft background noise. Even at higher output, it remains quieter than many comparable units at their lowest setting (typically above 50 dB). (Size: 13.19\"L \u00d7 8.66\"W \u00d7 17.99\"H | Weight: 25.35 lb)",
      "\u3010Premium Components and Advanced Engineering\u3011The Boreas series integrates a high-efficiency Pro+ piston compressor. Key components, including the evaporator and condenser, use 7 mm high-tooth inner-threaded pure copper tubing\u2014never low-grade aluminum pipes\u2014paired with blue hydrophilic aluminum fins to enhance heat exchange efficiency and system stability.",
      "\u3010Accurate and Responsive Humidity Control\u3011 Powered by a modern control architecture and high-performance chip, the system continuously monitors environmental humidity and maintains a stable, comfortable range. A proprietary humidity compensation algorithm improves accuracy and consistency beyond typical household dehumidifiers.",
      "\u3010Engineered for Long-Term Use\u3011Aeocky features a specialized compressor design that helps reduce frequent start\u2013stop cycling, extending the unit\u2019s lifespan. While others use aluminum tubing, Boreas uses more durable materials and is designed to provide stable performance for 3+ years under normal household conditions.",
      "\u3010Performance in Cooler Conditions\u3011Many compressor dehumidifiers struggle or stop working when temperatures drop below 65\u2109. Boreas features a frost-proof coated evaporator and advanced defrost sensors, allowing consistent humidity reduction at temperatures as low as 42\u2109. This makes it suitable for maintaining a comfortable indoor environment year-round.",
      "\u3010Broad Coverage and Versatile Use\u3011Plan for the long term \u2014 one Boreas unit can handle spaces up to 3500 sq.ft, delivering stable performance for most daily environments. It also works efficiently in smaller areas, removing humidity faster, enhancing comfort, and reducing energy consumption. A single unit provides lasting value without the need for frequent upgrades.",
      "\u3010Designed for User Convenience\u3011 Choose between continuous drainage using the included hose or connecting a garden hose via the adapter, or opt for easy manual emptying. The transparent water tank features automatic shutoff when full. With 360\u00b0 caster wheels and an integrated handle, the unit is easy to move, while the multicolor ambient light provides a clear visual indication of humidity levels.",
      "\u3010Why Choose AEOCKY\u3011Aeocky focuses on delivering practical technology for everyday living. The product is certified by ETL, RoHS, REACH, NRCan, and more, and includes 3-year product coverage, exceeding typical market standards."
