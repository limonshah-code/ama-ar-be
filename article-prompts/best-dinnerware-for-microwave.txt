Included are (4) 10.5\" dinner plates, (4) 7.5\" dessert plates, (4) 27 oz cereal bowls, and (4) 30 oz pasta bowls. Pairs perfectly with our Grow Forward cups sets!",

      "[ Dishwasher Safe & Microwave Safe ] - Fridge and freezer safe too!

However, they will not break or chip like porcelain or ceramic and won't splinter like wood, making them a great option for everyday use.",

Wheat straw dishes have a smaller carbon footprint than reusable plastic plates and consume less energy than other materials without harming forests or altering natural ecosystems. Thank you for supporting an American small business."
