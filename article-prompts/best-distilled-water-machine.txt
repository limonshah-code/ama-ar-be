      "Efficient Water Purification: The 750-watt heating element allows our home water distiller to produce up to 0.3 Gal (1 L) per hour and about 6 Gal (24 L) per day. It can effectively dissolve solids, VOCs and other impurities, offering you the pure distilled water for drinking at ease. Apart from distilling water, it can be used to make alcohol and essential oil as well. Perfect for offices, homes, labs, dental clinics, etc.",
      "Upgraded Timing Function: In addition to the conventional functions of the previous types, our distilled water maker spotlights timing function. The 0-99 H timing range is ideal for constant temperature fermentation, perfectly meeting your needs of making alcohol, essential oil, and hydrosol. Plus, it is suggested to set 3.5 hours when distilling 1.1 Gal (4 L) water. In this way, some water will remain at the bottom at the end of distillation, which can effectively reduce limescale.",
      "Precise Temperature Display: Our countertop water distiller is designed with an intuitive control panel, displaying the setting temperature, which ranges from 30\u2103 (86\u2109) to 108\u2103 (226.4\u2109). It allows you to better control the distillation process. Besides, from the comfort of the dry-burning protection, it will stop heating when the temperature exceeds 115\u2103 (239\u2109), and shut down automatically when it is over 150\u2103 (302\u2109).",
      "Selected Materials & Fast Heat Dissipation: All the parts that come into contact with water adopt food-grade 304 stainless steel, including the internal tank, inner cap, and water outlet. The 1.1 Gal (4 L) glass carafe with silicone buffer won't crack or break easily. It can store the distilled water longer than those plastic ones. A built-in 4-blade aluminum fan as well as the SUS 304 condensing coil is durable enough to ensure rapid heat dissipation and extended service life.",
      "User-Friendly Accessories: To provide you with a better using experience, we kindly offer a bottle of cleaning powder and 3 pieces of replaceable carbon packages. It is hassle-free to clean the internal tank with the cleaning powder. The limescale can be minimized if you leave some water at the bottom at the end of each distillation. Installing the carbon pack at the water outlet can further purify the distilled water and adjust its taste."
