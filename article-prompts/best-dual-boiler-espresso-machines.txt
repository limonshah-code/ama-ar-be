It's also crucial to use freshly ground coffee, as if the grounds have been exposed to air for an extended period, the oils inside will evaporate, leading to lower pressure.

      "Useful Tips: If your machine shows \u201cEP\u201d or a low-water warning but the tank is full, don\u2019t worry \u2014 it\u2019s usually not a fault. This can happen when the grind is too fine or the coffee is tamped too hard, blocking the flow. Simply use a slightly coarser grind and try again. Coarse grind, low dose, or weak tamping can also cause low pressure and thin crema. Always use freshly ground beans (18\u201319 g for a double shot). Once you find the right grind, extraction becomes perfect. If you need help, please contact us anytime."
