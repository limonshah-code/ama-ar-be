    "features": [
      "DIGITAL MANIFOLD GAUGE SET: Rogvoc manifold gauges have functions such as refrigerant filling, dual pressure and air tightness test, vacuum degree test, temperature test, condensation evaporation pressure, etc. Built-in 93 types of refrigerant data can be switched or filled with different types of refrigerants according to needs. The 32-bit digital precision data acquisition unit has good data stability, making the pressure data measurement more stable and accurate.",
      "MULTIFUNCTION GAUGES: Digital manifold gauge can not only complete the pressure/temperature test when refrigerant is charged, and refrigerant condensation/evaporation pressure and temperature can be automatically tested. Vacuum test can measure the value and percentage of vacuum pressure to determine the air tightness of the pipeline, you can observe the pressure difference to determine whether there is a leak in the refrigeration system pipeline, and record the duration of the leak test",
      "PARAMETERS: Pressure test range:0-6000 Kpa; Resolution: 1 Kpa; Accuracy: plus or minus 0.5% (FS); Maximum overload pressure: 10000 Kpa(10 Mpa/100 bar). Vacuuming test range: -101 Kpa - 0 Kpa; Resolution: 1 Kpa. 3-color hose newly added knob handle design makes it easier to install the hose while protecting your hands from frostbite from leaking refrigerant (Hoses maximum working pressure of 600 PSI)",
      "CONVENIENCE DESIGN: The refrigeration digital gauges adopts a visual window design, which allows you to observe the filling status of the refrigerant at any time; gauges system multiple built-in pressure units and temperature units for free switching; the TFT LCD display can help you easily read data in a dimly lit or dark environment; back hook design allows you to easily and labor-savingly perform tests or other work",
      "CUSTOMER SUPPORT: We provide 7 x 24 hours customer support. If you have any questions about the product, please feel free to contact us, we will reply within 24 hours and help you. Packing includes: digital manifold gauge x 1, 5 FT colored hose x 3, thermometer clamps x 2, replacement valve core and toolbox (Battery included)"
