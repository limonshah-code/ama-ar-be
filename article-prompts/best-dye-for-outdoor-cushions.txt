      "\u3010Indoor/Outdoor Fabric Options\u3011The bench cushion is available in both indoor and outdoor fabric options. Outdoor fabric is made of composite technology, which not only has excellent durability and weather resistance, but also has excellent splash-proof performance, even if accidentally spilled liquid on it, it can be easily wiped up to keep the seat cushion neat and clean.",
      "\u3010Special Craftsmanship\u3011Our bench cushions offer customised *single piping/double piping* to increase the beauty of the product. *Zipper*: different zip methods can facilitate the removal of the cover, better cleaning of the cover, and ensure the cushion's tidiness. *Hugging cover*: customised cover can make your cushion more complete and look more beautiful.",
      "\u3010Two Fixing Methods\u3011The indoor custom cushion offers a choice of 3 types of straps and 6 non-slip bottom styles. The straps can help you to bind the cushion to the seat cushion and should not be moved. The non-slip bottom is made of plastic particles, which can increase the friction between the cushion and the chair, so that the cushion is not easy to be shifted, so you can use it with confidence."
