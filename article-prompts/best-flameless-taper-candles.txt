      "The light is a warm white color encased in a yellow flame designed to be as realistic as possible. It automatically flickers when you turn the candle on, increasing the realism. The real paraffin wax is a traditional ivory color. Perfect for year-round use, they will go with just about any d\u00e9cor style.",
      "The candles take 1 AA batteries, and provide around 100 hours of runtime. Batteries are not included. When using the timer function, the candle will light up for 5 hours, and then automatically shut off for 19 hours. With proper care, these flameless candles will provide years of lovely, safe illumination.",
      "Candles come packaged in sturdy boxes to protect them during the shipping process. They also are easy to wrap without having to search for just the right shaped box. They make excellent presents for any occasion--Christmas, birthdays, Mother's Day, party hostess gifts, or even for yourself!"
