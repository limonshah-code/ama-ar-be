We recommend replacing your brass nozzle with a stainless steel nozzle and using an all-metal hot end. Brass nozzles run the risk of containing lead, which can be dangerous for your health if consumed.",
      "\u3010Food Safe Suggestions\u3011-- We suggest that you use a stainless steel nozzle and a stainless steel all-metal hot-end. Use a separate nozzle and hot end for Food Grade models. A second hot-end will keep your Food-Grade prints free from contaminants.",
      "\u3010Food Safe Slicing and Model Finishing\u3011-- Depending on your slicing methods, your 3d Printing Machine, your finishing process, and your intended usage, the Food Safe Quality of your end product may change. Be sure to properly finish your models and use an appropriate sanitizer between uses of your end product. Printing solid models is advised.",
      "\u3010Difference Between Food Grade and Food Safe\u3011-- Food-Grade means that the material is fit for human consumption or permitted to come into contact with food. Food-Safe means that the Food-Grade material is also fit for purpose, for its intended use, and will not create a food-safety hazard. For example, it may be fit for purpose to use a Food-Grade container to hold a dry ingredient, but that same container may not be fit for purpose to be used to hold a hot liquid.",
      "\u3010Food Safe Considerations\u3011-- Just because a material is permitted to come into contact with food does not necessarily mean it is Food-Safe. Our Filament is Food Grade, and without modification is also Food Safe. Once the Filament is molded or extruded into a new shape, by the end user, the Food Safe Qualities need to be reassessed. For example: PLA is not rated for oven temperatures. Using this plastic to make muffin tins would not be a Food Safe application."
