      "Natural Materials - Our wood seasoning beeswax for furniture is made from natural beeswax and mixed with mineral oil according to traditional techniques. They are silicone-free, GMO-free, paraffin-free, non-toxic and environmentally friendly. Due to the properties of its natural materials, beeswax must be protected from light. The storage temperature is between 15 and 25 \u00b0C. Changes in the outside temperature cause deformation without affecting the use.",
      "Easy and Safe to Use - Firstly ensure that the surface is free from dust and dirt. Apply the beeswax evenly to the surface of the wood using a sponge or soft cloth. Leave for about 15-30 minutes to allow the wood to absorb the oils in the beeswax. Then wipe off the excess with a clean, soft cloth. Allow the furniture to dry naturally: in a dry, ventilated area, it will take at least 2 hours and may take up to 24 hours to dry completely.",
      "Furniture Reborn - Using all-around beeswax furniture polish can not only remove wax and dirt accumulation over the years but also polish it to restore the appearance of old furniture, making it look like a brand new product. It forms a protective film on the wooden surface, which keeps the furniture its natural and beautiful appearance for a long time.",
      "Multiple Uses - The almighty bees waxing furniture polish is very suitable for wooden furniture, doors, cupboards, stairs, wooden floors, etc. Our wood restoration beeswax not only can be used on finished furniture surfaces but also unfinished wood surfaces. It is also the best choice for arts and crafts. Safe on all treated woods.",
      "Commitment - Please note: Although beeswax is made of food-safe beeswax with natural ingredients, please do not consume it. If you have any questions about our beeswax, please let us know immediately and will get back to you within 24 hours."
