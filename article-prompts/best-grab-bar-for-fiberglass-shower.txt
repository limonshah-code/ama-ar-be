This step helps ensure a proper fit, prevents installation errors, and reduces the need for product returns.",
      "[Compatibility & Safety Requirements for Fiberglass Showers]: Engineered specifically for fiberglass shower enclosures with wood studs, The Solid Mount provides the structural backing required for a safe grab-bar installation. Fiberglass walls are not structural, major shower manufacturers specify that grab bars must anchor into wood studs, structural blocking, or factory reinforcement\u2014not into fiberglass alone. The Solid Mount fits most grab bars (sold separately) with 2\u00bd\" or 3\" round flanges from brands like Kohler, American Standard, and Amazon Basics. A visible \u00bc\" white ring may appear when using 2\u00bd\" flanges. Not compatible with tile, marble, drywall, or any type of metal studs.",
      "[Engineered Mounting System for Structural Load Transfer]: The Solid Mount connects directly to wood studs using adjustable spacers and a 5/16\" x 4\" lag bolt installed through a 2\" opening in the fiberglass wall. Once secured, your grab bar (not included) is mounted firmly to the framing for a water-tight, high-strength installation. This design eliminates stress on the fiberglass surface, preventing cracks and ensuring long-term stability in safety-critical environments. Installation typically takes about one hour.",
