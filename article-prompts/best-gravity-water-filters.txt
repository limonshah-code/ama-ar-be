      "THE ONLY GRAVITY FILTER CERTIFIED TO REMOVE MICROPLASTICS, LEAD & TOTAL PFAS: Enjoy cleaner, safer water with our carbon and ceramic water filter certified to NSF/ANSI-42 standards to reduce harmful contaminants. Each gravity water filter reduces microplastics, lead and forever chemicals, while keeping in essential minerals like calcium and magnesium. Ceramic filters are not designed to reduce TDS (total dissolved solids), so TDS readings may stay the same or slightly rise while still giving you healthier, safer water.",
      "COMPATIBLE WITH BERKEY WATER FILTERS: All Berkey water filters fit inside Culligan gravity dispensers, including Berkey Black BB9-2 Water Filter Replacement. The Culligan MaxClear countertop water filter system is also compatible with Boroux, ProOne, Doulton, Purewell and Waterdrop replacement filters.",
      "EASY INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE: No electricity or plumbing required. Place this water filtration system anywhere in your house and simply fill up a glass to enjoy fresh, clean drinking water. The large gallon capacity requires fewer refills, making it the perfect water filter for home, and provides enough daily drinking water for a small family of up to 3 people.",
      "POWERFUL CARBON AND CERAMIC WATER FILTER: Culligan gives you certified filtration that lower priced gravity filters can\u2019t match. Unlike many low-cost gravity water filter system alternatives, our carbon and ceramic water filter features both a high-grade ceramic outer shell and a filter core that is made of proprietary carbon-based granular material to reduce contaminants.",
      "COUNTERTOP WATER FILTER DISPENSER WITH DURABLE, SLEEK DESIGN: Our thoughtfully designed stainless steel water filter dispenser comes with a polished finish for better-for-you hydration that looks good and tastes better. Includes a stainless steel spigot and stand for easy use. When you\u2019re finished, the Scout gravity water filter system nests within itself to store at less than 12 inches tall."
