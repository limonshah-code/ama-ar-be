      "[Portable, Durable & Effortlessly Clean] - Compact yet robust, the OX Grinder is your perfect travel companion, ready to deliver fresh coffee wherever you go. Its durable design withstands the demands of daily use, while the included cleaning brush makes maintenance a breeze.",
      "[Usage & Performance Optimization Tips] - For best results, limit continuous grinding to 10 sessions for pour-over or 3 for espresso to avoid activating the overheat protection (requires a 15-minute cooldown if triggered). During grinding, some beans may remain unground; a gentle shake of the OX will resolve this. After grinding, tap the bottom of the OX with moderate force to help release coffee grounds stuck at the exit due to static.",
      "[Important Cleaning Tips] - Always clean with a brush after each use; for best results, grind 1\u20132g of coffee beans before use to clean the interior; never wash with water to avoid damaging the circuit board."
