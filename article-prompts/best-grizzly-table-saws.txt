    "features": [
      "MEASURE YOUR FACTORY INSERT AND COMPARE SIZE BEFORE YOU ORDER. Zero Clearance inserts are table saw specific. Since every table saw brand and manufacturer is different, we recommend that you measure the exact length, width and thickness of your table saw insert or opening and compare it to the size we list. Also be aware of the shape of your current insert of whether its round, square ends or if there are any indents or protruding notches. Insert colors may vary from images shown.",
      "If you own a table saw, then you probably have had smaller pieces of wood get caught between the saw blade and the factory supplied throat plate opening. This can cause that piece of wood to jam up against the blade and go flying across the room or worse yet, right back at you. Zero clearances help minimize this situation from happening since there is no gap between the blade and the zero clearance opening. The opening is more like a custom slot cut to the exact width of your table saw blade.",
      "Another great reason to use a zero clearance insert is to help reduce that pesky and irritating tear out you always tend to get on your cuts. Without a zero clearance, the wood has no support by the blade to prevent the wood from tearing out. This is especially true when cutting plywood. Zero clearance inserts help prevent tear out by essentially enveloping the blade on all sides which doesn\u2019t allow the wood to tear out since there is not gap between the blade and insert.",
      "Zero Clearance inserts can be used in conjunction with most any table saw blade including thin kerf, standard kerf and carbide tipped blades. You can also use zero clearance inserts with dado blade sets. The reason you would use zero clearance inserts with dado blades is to reduce the amount of tear out the dado blade set produces. We recommend that you use separate zero clearance inserts for dado blades since the gap for dados will be much wider than standard width table saw blades.",
      "This zero clearance insert is made from a high density phenolic material that was chosen for its ability to stand up to everyday workshop use. The insert features two Snug Fit sand-able side tabs that allow you to remove a little material at a time for a perfect fit if necessary. The insert also features a top and a side Snug Fit Screw for a tight fit to you saw with no movement!"
