With a clear view window, it's easy to monitor ice without opening the door.",
      "Two Ways to Fill: With manual filling, the colder the water, the quicker the ice. Or connect the included hose kit for automatic water filling and continuous supply. When using the automatic water fill, you can also attach a water filter for cleaner, purer ice balls. (Note: We recommend using purified or filtered water \u2014 higher water quality produces clearer ice spheres.)",
      "Automatic Cleaning: Simply press and hold the \"ON\" button for 3 seconds to activate self-cleaning, or choose manual cleaning for a hands-on approach. Enjoy a round ice cube maker that's always fresh and ready to deliver sphere ice for your favorite drinks!"
