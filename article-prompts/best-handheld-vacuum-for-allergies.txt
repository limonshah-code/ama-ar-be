Equipped with gravity-sensing wheels at the base, the UV-C light automatically turns on when the machine contacts the surface, and turns off automatically when lifted or tilted to prevent UV leakage and ensure safe use.",
      "\u3010Multi-Layer Filtration\u3011The handheld vacuum cleaner is designed with a layered filtration system and dual dust cup structure, providing enhanced filtration performance. The advanced HEPA filter captures 99.97% of fine particles as small as 0.3 microns, effectively separating impurities, skin flakes, and dust to prevent filter clogging. This prolongs the filter\u2019s lifespan and ensures consistently powerful suction.",
      "\u3010Safety Protection\u3011This roller brush is equipped with a locking rotor protection. If it becomes entangled in fabric, the rotor will automatically stop working. The unit is protected against over-voltage, over-current, over-heating and short-circuiting. Prolonged continuous operation may trigger the motor over-heating protection, resulting in a temporary shutdown. In this case, please turn off the unit and allow it to cool before resuming use it.",
