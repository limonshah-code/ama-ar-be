      "Channel Switching & Independent Control: The BanTamp XL series features a dedicated footswitch for channel switching and six knobs. This allows you to independently control both the CLEAN and DISTORTION channels, giving you precise command over each channel's Volume, Gain, and Tone for ultimate tonal flexibility.",
      "Versatile High-Gain Platform & Clean Pedal Foundation: The ZOMBIE-II excels at lower gain settings and responds brilliantly to your favorite overdrive pedals, letting you push into higher gain with their unique character. Its high-gain structure pairs perfectly with a noise gate for tight, articulate heavy chords. Its pristine CLEAN channel is also an exceptional pedal platform, making it a flexible and portable companion for any situation.",
      "Big Amp Feel in a Mini Head: Don't let its size fool you. Once you start playing, the ZOMBIE-II delivers a rich, responsive tone that feels like a much larger amplifier. Its impressive 20W output is remarkably loud and dynamic, perfect for practice, recording, or small gigs.",
      "Hybrid Design & Studio-Grade Features: This hybrid amp head combines a genuine 12AX7 tube in the preamp with a solid-state power section for rich harmonics and reliable performance. The studio-grade FX loop lets you place time-based and modulation effects (delays, reverbs, choruses, flangers, phasers) after the drive stage, keeping your effects clean and defined.",
      "Bluetooth & Silent Practice Ready: The built-in Bluetooth connectivity makes it easy to stream backing tracks or lessons directly to the amp for practice. For quiet sessions, use the headphone output with its integrated speaker cabinet emulation to play anywhere without disturbing others."

      "METEOR II maintains everything about the first generation of METEOR, 20 Watt head, compact and portable. It gives you a modern high gain sound with a lot of dirt and bite. Based on a more modern British approach to heavy sounds, it excels in a variety of genres",
      "The amp operates with a single 12AX7 tube in the preamp and uses a solid state power amp. the FX loop enables you to put your time based effects (or Phasers, Flangers and Choruses) behind the drive section and keep the effects sharp and not prevent them from being too muddy",
      "The METEOR XL has a CLEAN channel that can take pedals really well, which makes it flexible and a great little companion for many situations where your \"big\" head is just not sensible. Use a TS-type pedal (like the JOYO Green Legend or Vintage Overdrive) to push it into higher gain territory and hear it sing",
      "The icing on the cake is the Bluetooth connectivity is great to practice with Play Alongs or to learn songs. Careful, the amp is small, but loud\u2026 its 20 Watts can be quite a handful. If you want to practice quietly, use the built in headphone out with speaker emulation"
