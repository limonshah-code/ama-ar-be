Warm sunny weather will accelerate systemic movement from leaves and stems down to the roots to give complete kill. When applied in cooler temperatures Grass Getter will take up to 3 weeks to kill weeds.",
      "MIX & SPRAY \u2013 For best control, simply mix Grass Getter concentrate with a surfactant/oil concentrate (like Monterey Herbicide Helper) and water and spray on to flowerbeds, groundcovers or in garden areas. Addition of a surfactant/oil concentrate helps the Grass Getter penetrate the surface of the weed for better weed control."
