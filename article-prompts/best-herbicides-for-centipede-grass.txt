It will not control nutsedge (nutgrass), annual bluegrass (poa annua) or broadleaf weeds.",
      "SPRAY OVER THE TOP - This systemic selective herbicide kills unwanted and unsightly weedy grass vegetation down to the root without injuring desirable plants in your yard. Can be applied over listed ornamental plants and trees to control unwanted grassy weeds growing amongst them. Not for use in lawn areas.",
      "EASY TO USE \u2013 Grass Getter should be applied when grassy weeds are actively growing. Warm sunny weather will accelerate systemic movement from leaves and stems down to the roots to give complete kill. When applied in cooler temperatures Grass Getter will take up to 3 weeks to kill weeds.",
      "MIX & SPRAY \u2013 For best control, simply mix Grass Getter concentrate with a surfactant/oil concentrate (like Monterey Herbicide Helper) and water and spray on to flowerbeds, groundcovers or in garden areas. Addition of a surfactant/oil concentrate helps the Grass Getter penetrate the surface of the weed for better weed control."
