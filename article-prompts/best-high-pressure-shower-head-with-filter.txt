      "Purchase Information: The spray mode is recommended for facial cleansing in cold weather as it produces a cool mist. The reason why the spray mode produces a cooler mist is that when water evaporates quickly in the air, it absorbs some heat, making the mist feel cooler than the original water temperature. This cool mist is particularly refreshing in hot weather, helping to reduce heat and invigorate the senses."
