Our strips are specifically calibrated for the high mineral content of soil. The low ion concentration in water can cause an inaccurate reading that reflects the paper's base pH. Different liquids require different testing methods for precise results; 2. Keep Strips Horizontal: For the most accurate pH and nitrogen readings, keep the test strip horizontal during the testing process. The nitrogen test pad contains an acidic substance that can contaminate the pH test pad if the strip is held vertically, leading to an incorrect result."
