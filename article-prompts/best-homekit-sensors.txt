      "[External Sensor Integration & Secondary Area Display] The W100 can connect to an Aqara temperature and humidity sensor to display additional data in the Secondary screen area. If no external sensor is connected, the Secondary screen defaults to the local weather report for temperature and humidity info. (Please note: Linking with an Aqara temperature and humidity sensor and enabling the Secondary screen display are only available through the Aqara Home app on Zigbee mode when connected to an Aqara hub",
      "[Remote HVAC Control Integration] The W100 supports pairing with a third-party IR air-conditioner via Aqara Hub M3, allowing wireless remote control of the HVAC system.(Only zigbee mode) You can adjust temperature, mode, and other settings directly on the device, optimizing comfort and energy efficiency without needing to access the HVAC device physically. This feature adds convenience and ensures a comfortable living environment",
      "[Long Battery Life & Configurable Performance] Powered by 2 CR2450 batteries, the W100 delivers up to 2.4 years of battery life on Zigbee mode and 2.3 years on Thread mode. Customize reporting frequency to optimize the device\u2019s performance and power consumption, ensuring long-lasting and hassle-free operation"

      "Motion & Presence Detection: Presence Sensor combines mmWave radar with light-sensing technology and PIR sensor to accurately detect subtle chest movements from stationary humans. Perfect for bathrooms, reading, or office use, it prevents lights from turning off unexpectedly and enables automated lighting.",
      "Battery Design & Flexible Installation: Equipped with a long-lasting battery, this sensor frees you from power cables and can operate up to 2 years on a single charge. The magnetic base allows flat placement, wall mounting, and adjustable detection angles, making it ideal for bathrooms, living rooms, studies, and other areas throughout your home.",
      "Smart Automations: Presense Sensor works without a hub for instant, second-level response. Seamlessly pair with SwitchBot devices (e.g., Bot, Curtain, Light Series, etc. ) with local linkage and set up to 5 automations. For more complex automations, pair with a SwitchBot Hub to trigger smart scenarios, such as automatically turning on lights and air purifiers while working from home.",
      "AI Anti-Interference: Enable AI self-learning with one click to automatically filter out interference from fans, air conditioners, and more, improving detection accuracy. The magnetic base allows the Presence Sensor to rotate and adjust its detection zone, effectively preventing false triggers from pets and meeting diverse home needs.",
      "Full-Scene Coverage: 120\u00b0 wide-angle detection with a range of up to 8\u202fm for moving humans and 5\u202fm for stationary humans. Ensures complete coverage from bathroom to living room, meeting the sensing needs of every space.",
      "Multi-Platform Compatibility & Voice Control: Presense Sensor supports Apple Home via SwitchBot Matter Hub, Home Assistant, Alexa, Google Home, and other platforms."
