      "Diagnostic Function: Engineered to help you identify internal and external high-pressure oil system leaks without having to fully start the engine. By pressurizing the system with regulated shop air, you can quickly determine if leaks exist in the IPR valve, stand pipes, dummy plugs, or injector seals. It provides a safe and effective way to troubleshoot no-start or hard-start issues.",
      "Heavy-Duty Construction for Professional Use: Manufactured from high-quality solid brass and stainless steel, this air test fitting resists corrosion, deformation, and air leakage under high pressure. Each fitting is CNC machined for a precise fit and features reinforced threads for long-lasting durability. The robust design ensures stable performance even under repeated shop use, making it ideal for both professional diesel mechanics and enthusiasts.",
      "Easy-to-Use, Plug-and-Test Design: The kit features a simple connection interface that threads directly into the IPR valve port. Once installed, connect regulated shop air (100-140 PSI) and listen for escaping air to locate leaks quickly. Its plug-and-play design saves time on disassembly, reduces guesswork, and allows you to perform leak testing on both cold and warm engines with precision.",
      "Accurate High-Pressure Oil System Diagnosis: This IPR Air Test Tool Kit allows you to pinpoint internal and external leaks in the high-pressure oil system before starting the engine. By connecting to the IPR valve port and applying regulated air pressure, you can locate issues such as faulty injector O-rings, stand pipes, dummy plugs, or IPR valves. It helps prevent unnecessary disassembly and part replacement. This diagnostic method is safe, efficient, and trusted by professional technicians.",
