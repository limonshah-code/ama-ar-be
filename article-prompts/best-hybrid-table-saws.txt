      "Contractor table saw misalignment is common on a lot of saws. However, it is also one of the easiest issues to fix at a relatively low cost to do so. PALS allow you to make fine adjustments to the contractor saws rear trunnions, giving you the central to turn you saw into a perfectly aligned, precision cutting machine.",
      "If you own a contractor style table saw (your table saw motor hanging out the back of the saw denotes a contractor style saw), you may have noticed that the saw may not be properly aligned. Meaning, the saw blade is not parallel with the miter slot on our table saw top. A poorly aligned table saw is not only frustrating to use, but also is dangerous to operate.",
      "The smartly made but simple to install PALS (Precision Alignment and Locking System) offer the perfect solution to getting your contractor table saw properly aligned without all the headaches. For years, the accepted technique for aligning contractor table saws was normally accomplished with a hammer and a piece of wood along with a bit of brute force. Not something we should be doing to our woodworking investment.",
      "The main component of the system are the \u201cL\u201d brackets with micro-adjusting screws. We use to these to make the necessary adjustments. The end result of Precision Alignment & Locking System (PALS) installation can be a perfectly aligned saw in less than 15 minutes, and the rear trunnion will be \u201clocked in position\u201d to prevent the saw from coming out of alignment again.",
      "PALS are designed for most saws where the motor hangs out the rear. Installing them on \u201chybrid\u201d saws may prove difficult, as access to the rear housing (trunnion) may be very limited. PALS are available in 3 stud sizes, which will fit most saws with 5/16\u201d, 3/8\u201d, or 8MM bolts that hold the rear trunnion in position. Before ordering, please measure the bolt that holds your rear trunnions in place. If it does not match any of the three size mentioned here, the PALS will not work with your saw."
