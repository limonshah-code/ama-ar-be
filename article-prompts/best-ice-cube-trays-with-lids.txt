No longer worry about breaking easily. Besides, our silicone bottom is soft enough to release the ice easily, so twisting is no longer needed, which makes the ice trays even more durable",
      "Easy to Use: Just fill the tray to the max line, put the cover on, put the tray in your freezer until completely frozen, and lastly pop out the ice cubes. One thing to note is that you'd better wait about 30 seconds before opening the lid when it's frozen. In this way, opening the lid could be effortless. Besides, the tray is super easy to clean and dishwasher safe",
      "Stackable Design: The Ice Tray with a removable lid which can not only keep your ice away from any freezer smell, but also enables the trays to stack on top of each other perfectly. And the stackable design is beneficial to space saving, keeping your freezer clean and organized",
      "Easy to Release: The ice tray creatively combines plastic and silicone. Top 1/2 of the tray is plastic which helps keep its shape unlike full silicone trays. And the silicone bottom makes it super easy to release the ice. Thus, unlike the old rigid plastic trays, there's no fighting and twisting to get the ice out. Additionally, these trays make rectangular ice cubes which look great in any drink. They are perfect for baby food, cocktail, coffee, fruit, soda, juice, whiskey, etc. With these trays, you can enjoy ice drinks whenever you want"
