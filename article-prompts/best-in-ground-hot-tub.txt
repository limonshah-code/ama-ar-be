      "Magnetic Drive Design: This design eliminates the need for physical seals between the rotating and stationary components which means that there are no dynamic seals that can wear out or leak, leads to lower energy consumption, reduced operating costs, and a longer lifespan for the equipment",
      "Spa Cleaning Head: It activates the low water-level cleaning mode, allowing it to function properly even in water depths as shallow as 0.6 feet. Additionally, it increases suction power by approximately 20% due to the shorter distance to the motor",
      "Higher Performance: This handheld pool vacuum built in an improved DC brush motor, the max flow rate can be up to 380 gal per hour. After fully charged, the vacuum can run up to 70 minutes and this battery life will allow you to clean your pool without interruption and get the job done quickly",
      "Catch Most Debris: Because of fine filter and powerful suction, this vacuum can pick up almost every debris in your hot tub or spa within minutes",
      "Be aware of some vacuum with the auto turn on, it might be convenient at first but it also has risk of accidental turning on in the air and causes damage. Their lifespan usually doesn't last long."
