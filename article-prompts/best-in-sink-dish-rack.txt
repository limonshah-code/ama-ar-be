      "Overlapping Design & Locking Screws: The rack features an overlapping two-piece design that slides smoothly without parts bumping when you expand or contract it to fit different sink sizes. Simple screw installation lets you set the length and lock it in place, helping prevent slipping or shifting during washing.",
      "Stable 90\u00b0 L-Shaped Support: Unlike other in-sink dish racks that rest on a single countertop edge, our embedded 90\u00b0 L-frame grips both the counter and the sink wall for dual support and even weight distribution. This prevents tipping from uneven loads or bumps, keeping your tableware safer."
