      "\u3010Wok Induction Cooker\u3011: The Abangdun 110V-120V induction cooktop is suitable for all North American households and commercial applications. Its compact design makes it the perfect choice for outdoor cooking, meeting a wide range of culinary needs. The shallow concave surface design is based on the heating principle of induction hotplate, ensuring compatibility with round-bottom woks even if the curve isn\u2019t a perfect match.",
      "\u3010Non-Cyclic/Pulsed Heating\u3011: The Abangdun wok induction burner provides uniform heating at all power levels, unlike others that use pulsed heating at low settings. This ensures stable heating for a better cooking experience. If no cookware is detected within 10 seconds, an \"E1\" error will appear. Simply replace the cookware to continue.",
      "\u3010High Efficiency\u3011: This concave induction cooktop is more efficient than electric hot plates, electric ranges, or gas stoves with the same power, providing rapid heat-up and faster cooking times.

With no open flame and no exhaust emissions, it ensures a safer and more eco-friendly cooking experience.",

      "\u3010Friendly Reminder\u3011This concave induction cooktop has a shallow curve, so it doesn\u2019t require a perfect match with the wok\u2019s curvature, as stir-frying involves tossing the wok. The concave coil ensures effective heating within a certain distance range, providing stable heat even if the wok\u2019s curve isn\u2019t exact. It is also compatible with flat-bottom pans with a diameter smaller than 9 inches."
