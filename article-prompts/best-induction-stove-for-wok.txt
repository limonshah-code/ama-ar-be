      "\u3010Wok Induction Cooker\u3011: The Abangdun 110V-120V induction cooktop is suitable for all North American households and commercial applications. Its compact design makes it the perfect choice for outdoor cooking, meeting a wide range of culinary needs. The shallow concave surface design is based on the heating principle of induction hotplate, ensuring compatibility with round-bottom woks even if the curve isn\u2019t a perfect match.",
      "\u3010Non-Cyclic/Pulsed Heating\u3011: The Abangdun wok induction burner provides uniform heating at all power levels, unlike others that use pulsed heating at low settings. This ensures stable heating for a better cooking experience. If no cookware is detected within 10 seconds, an \"E1\" error will appear. Simply replace the cookware to continue.",
      "\u3010High Efficiency\u3011: This concave induction cooktop is more efficient than electric hot plates, electric ranges, or gas stoves with the same power, providing rapid heat-up and faster cooking times. The induction burner automatically stops working if the temperature becomes too high or if the pan is removed from the surface. With no open flame and no exhaust emissions, it ensures a safer and more eco-friendly cooking experience.",
      "\u3010Double Switch\u3011:This induction hotplate features two switch modes: a button switch (press on/off) and a knob switch (press switch).17 Power levels from 200W to 1700W.17 temperature levels from 176\u00b0F/80\u00b0 to 464\u00b0F/240\u00b0C. The knob allows for quick adjustment of levels.",
      "\u3010Friendly Reminder\u3011This concave induction cooktop has a shallow curve, so it doesn\u2019t require a perfect match with the wok\u2019s curvature, as stir-frying involves tossing the wok. The concave coil ensures effective heating within a certain distance range, providing stable heat even if the wok\u2019s curve isn\u2019t exact. It is also compatible with flat-bottom pans with a diameter smaller than 9 inches."
