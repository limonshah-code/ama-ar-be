      "Practicality: 31 * 19 inches, providing more ample space for children to lie down and sleep or sit up and play on the plane, alleviating discomfort in children's legs and feet, and also relieving mother's hands. The children's airplane travel bed is an excellent choice for taking children out, making travel more relaxed and enjoyable. Extra earplugs are equipped to make travel more comfortable and enjoyable.",
      "Better Material: The children's airplane bed is made of ultra soft velvet fabric, which provides good comfort whether sitting or lying down. The back is equipped with anti slip small rubber pads to prevent slipping during use. The storage bag can better store children's toys and snacks.",
      "Convenient to use and carry: As long as one side with an inflatable pillow is hung on the front small table and chair, and the other side is fixed on the back of the chair, it can be used. The toddler flat bed is lightweight, only 8 ounces, with a compressed size of only 9.4 * 7.8 * 0.5 inches. Compact, lightweight, foldable for easy storage.",
      "Easy to set up: The portable inflatable foot pad (using an inflatable pillow) can be inflated with an inflation cylinder, which is more time-saving and labor-saving. If you don't know how to store and deflate, you can refer to the manual or search for the best answer using a browser. There are specialized instructions for the installation and disassembly of the travel bed and inflatable pillow for reference. If you have any doubts, please feel free to contact us and we will provide you with the most satisfactory solution as soon as possible.",
      "Please consult the airline in advance: this children's travel plane bed can be used for window seats with seat trays or middle row seats, but cannot be used for aisle seats and exit row seats. Please confirm the seat size and whether the airline allows the use and installation before traveling."
