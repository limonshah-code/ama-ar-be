      "High Quality Material: The car intake manifold heater hose threaded connector is made of high-quality iron material. Iron itself has higher hardness, and even if used for a long time, its surface is not easily cracked or damaged, and it can maintain a tight fit with hoses and manifolds. At the same time, the structural stability of iron material is strong, and it can always maintain its shape without interface misalignment caused by these external forces.",
      "Scope of Application: The size of car intake manifold heater hose threaded connector is 0.87 \u00d7 1.77 inches. This product is compatible with the 1964-1979, Nova, and Impala. Simultaneously following the interface standards of small cylinder engines, it can be matched with the intake manifold heating system of SBC 283, 350, 383 series engines.",
      "Easy Installation: The car intake manifold heater hose threaded connector is very simple. Let the engine cool down first and disconnect the heater related connections. After dismantling the old connector and cleaning the interface, insert the 5/8\" end of the new connector into the hose, connect the 1/2\" NPT end to the intake manifold, and tighten it. Reinstall the snap bolt, check for any looseness or leakage, and restore the heater connection.",
      "Stable Transmission: The car intake manifold heater hose threaded connector adopts a 1/2\" NPT external thread and a 5/8\" hook interface design, which can achieve stable fluid transmission between the hose and the manifold, ensure the normal delivery of the medium in the heating system, provide strong support for maintaining the appropriate temperature of the engine intake manifold, and is an important guarantee for the stable operation of the heating system.",
      "Tight Connection: The car intake manifold heater hose threaded connector can be firmly embedded in the inner wall of the hose, preventing the hose from falling off during use. The threaded connection ensures that there is no gap between the joint and the manifold. The connection method not only avoids displacement between the hose and the joint, but also eliminates leakage between the joint and the manifold."
