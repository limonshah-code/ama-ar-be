      "Water Inlet Requirements: The inlet water temperature must not exceed 45\u00b0C (113\u00b0F). The water supply must meet municipal tap water standards. Well water or other alternative sources are not permitted unless an additional pre-filtration system is installed. For optimal performance of the electrolysis unit, water flow rate must be properly regulated. A flow rate that is too low may lead to over-electrolysis, while excessively high flow may result in insufficient electrolysis. Recommended flow rate: 1.0\u20133.5 L/min, optimal flow rate: 1.5\u20132.0 L/min",
      "Installation Tip 1: The ionized water machine is compatible with standard internal thread faucets, external thread faucets, and non-threaded faucets. However, it is not suitable for showerheads and uncommon faucets. For a seamless setup, please watch the video on our product page first. Contact our customer service immediately if you have any questions. We promise a quick response!",
      "Installation Tip 2: This alkaline water machine is filter-free. The input water quality should meet the local drinking water quality standard. City ormunicipal water is recommended, Well water or ground water which containsimpurities, chemicals and heavy metals is not recommended. If use the Reverse RO system as the pre-filters, then please make sure thewater TDS(Total Dissolved Solid)feeding to the ionizer is over 80ppm."
