The black composite filter employs a 0.01 \u03bcm hollow fiber UF membrane, a fluoride reduction material membrane, a silver ion membrane and an activated carbon block to reduce fluoride, chlorine, organic matter and heavy metals. The PH filter (white) uses high-end alkalizing materials to alkalize the water and is equipped with dual-layer sediment PP membranes to intercept impurities.",
      "90% Fluoride Reduction - The black composite filter is made of high-grade activated carbon and fluoride removal material (not alumina material, will not cause harm to human health like alumina), it can remove 90% of fluoride while ensuring safe use. This composite design combines the function of carbon filter with fluoride filter, but costs less for the same results.",
      "Enjoy Healthy Alkaline Water - The white PH filter is meticulously designed to raise the pH level of tap water, promoting overall health, accelerating detoxification, and enhancing bone and digestive health.",
      "Complete Accessory Set: The system not only provides safe water but also adds a touch of style to your home with its 304 food-grade stainless-steel housing.

Additionally, a non-slip stand is included to enhance the user experience. These accessories are included in the package, you don't have to spend extra money on additional accessories.",
      "Replaceable - The two PH filters (white) and the two black composite filters (black) can effectively filter up to 200 gallons of water and 6,000 gallons of water (According to different water quality, the lifespan of the filter elements would be a little different). But for optimum performance, the black composite filters should be replaced every 6 months. The service life of the PH filter element is relatively short and needs to be replaced every 2 months."
