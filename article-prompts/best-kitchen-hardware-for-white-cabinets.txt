Easily coordinate with your existing hardware or refresh your cabinets with a new look.",
      "\u3010Understand the Key Dimensions for a Perfect Fit\u3011 Before choosing your cabinet pulls, focus on three key measurements that ensure the best fit and appearance.

Knowing these helps you pick the pull that fits precisely and looks perfectly balanced on your cabinets.",
      "\u3010Find the Right Length for Every Drawer and Door\u3011 Not all cabinets are created equal \u2014 and neither are their handles. Wider drawers (24\"\u201336\") often look better with longer pulls or even a pair of handles to match their scale. Smaller drawers and doors work beautifully with shorter pulls or classic knobs.

      "\u3010Replace and Install with Confidence\u3011Whether you\u2019re upgrading old hardware or starting fresh, measuring your existing hole spacing is key. If the new pull size differs, simply fill the old holes and realign for a clean finish. For a quick visual test, use painter\u2019s tape to preview the pull\u2019s length and placement before drilling. Always keep the handle within the edge of the drawer or door for a neat, professional appearance.",
