      "\u3010Razor Sharp and Incredibly Durable\u3011This heavy meat cleaver knife is forged from premium German high carbon stainless steel with heat-treated and ice water cooled, resulting in a 56+ hardness",
      "\u3010Heavy and Thick Cleaver\u30111.33 pounds weight and 3.8mm thickness give this 7.5 inch butcher knife enough impact to get through thicker or denser bones effectively. 3.54 inch broadness allows the chef's fingers to work perfectly away from the cutting surface and make it convenient to move ingredients from the cutting board to the pan or plate.",
      "\u3010Superior Performance\u3011MAD SHARK heavy duty butcher chopper did excellent job on breaking down poultry and beef bones, and is ideal for pushing down on garlic cloves to crush them or squash",
      "\u3010Full Tang Design\u3011Full Tang, the most durable and sturdy tang type, means that our cleaver knife blade is one solid piece and the handle is formed by injection molding ABS around the blade. It provides unrivalled strenth and durability to the chopper cleaver. The shock-absorbing hole on the top of the knife back can effectively reduce the damage from the violent impact when chopping bones.",
      "\u3010Dishwasher Safe\u3011German High Carbon stainless steel 5CR15MOV performs excellent at rust resistance. Care still need to be taken to clean and dry the blade after use to avoid unnecessary corrosion."
