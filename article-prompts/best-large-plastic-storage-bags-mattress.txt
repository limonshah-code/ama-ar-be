This likely indicates the mattress has not been fully inserted into the bag, and the fabric has become caught in the zipper teeth. Instead, unzip a section, reposition the surrounding fabric, and gently try again. Never violently pull the zipper apart during use, as this can cause the surrounding stitching to break, leading to product damage."
