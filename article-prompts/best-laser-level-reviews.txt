      "Rechargeable Battery and 10-Hour Runtime: With its integrated 2200 mAh rechargeable battery, the Fanttik D2 laser level can work continuously for up to 10 hours on a single charge. The high-capacity battery can be recharged more than 500 times, which is very practical",
      "Accurate Precision and High Brightness: Our laser diode uses cutting-edge bright green light laser technology to produce a highly visible and accurate laser beam. When exposed to the same light source, green lasers are 4 times brighter than red lasers. With an accuracy within 1/8 in at 30 ft with our D2's precise laser, you can attain competent outcomes, ensuring optimal photos and shelf hanging always",
      "360\u00b0 Rotation, Portable, and Long-Lasting: This pocket-sized D2 laser level is portable, weighing only 0.56 lb. TPE rubber protects the body to provide increased durability and drop resistance. Furthermore, the magnetic bracket stand that comes with it easily fastens to a variety of metallic surfaces, allowing for 360\u00b0 rotation in any direction",
      "Outdoor-Friendly Pulse Mode: It works very well in both bright outdoor and indoor settings. With a receiver (which is not supplied), the working range in pulse mode reaches up to 164 ft. You can still work precisely even in direct sunshine, where the laser beam is less obvious",
      "Self-Leveling & Manual Mode: The lasers are made to self level once the pendulum is unlocked. The laser beam will flash every 0.5 seconds if the laser level is tilted so far that it is unable to self-level (> 4\u00b0). To allow for precise alignment at various angles, lock the pendulum into manual mode. The laser beam will remain fixed and flash every 4 seconds",
