      "Supportive + Soft & Firm - Our signature flippable firmness means you have two choices in one mattress to find the right fit for you. One side of the mattress has a soft, plush feel, or you can flip it over to the other side for a firmer, even more supportive feel. Memory foam infused with copper reacts under body weight with a firming response. This response is called Variable Support and unlike traditional memory foam, it provides increased support at deep compression areas.",
      "Advanced Coil System: for MINIMIZING MIDNIGHT MOTION - Because of the most advanced individually wrapped coil systems at its core, it not only provides excellent edge support, but it also gives the mattress the flexibility to conform to an adjustable base with ease. Each coil is pocketed and individually wrapped to prevent tangling. This design allows for Zero Motion Transfer, meaning, when your partner moves around, you won\u2019t feel a thing.",
      "Tri-Zone-Airflow Layers: These layers act as transition layers which absorb and transfer the shock between the comfort layer and the Infinity Edge Spring System while maintaining a soft (or firm depending on the side) sleeping experience. This technology carves out a small diamond pattern and a large hexagon pattern in the center to better support your hips and shoulders. The diamond and hexagon pattern create \u201cvalleys\u201d allowing cool air to enter the mattress while pushing hot air out.",
      "\"Love it Guaranteed\u201d - Try it for a few nights. If you don\u2019t love it, return it for a refund."
