      "Furniture Style - This leather dog couch blends design concepts with human sofas, providing a dedicated resting area for your dog while seamlessly integrating into your home d\u00e9cor. Its mid-century modern look makes it suitable for any room, including the living room, bedroom, and study. The elevated dog bed design allows you to easily reach your pet while relaxing, providing a closer physical and emotional connection.",
      "Premium Leather - The dog sofa features a brown oil-waxed leather exterior, giving it an elegant and vintage look. The waxed leather surface has a delicate, oily sheen, a slightly cool touch, and excellent breathability, ensuring your dog will enjoy sleeping on it. The leather's sturdy and durable nature allows your dog to jump and play freely without leaving marks.",
      "Suitable for Pets Under 70lbs - This dog sofa bed is filled with high-resilience memory foam in the base and armrests, offering both support and softness. A cotton layer sandwiched between the foam and leather not only creates a smooth silhouette but also adds to its soft touch. The 24.8''*21.7'' sleeping area is large enough to accommodate large and medium dogs weighing no more than 70 pounds, while the extended armrests and backrest provide more stretching space.",
      "Detailed Design - The sofa-like armrests provide good head and neck support for your dog while sleeping, preventing falls. The non-slip fabric on the bottom of the sofa prevents the pet bed from tipping over and ensures stability. The scratch-resistant fabric is durable and can withstand daily scratches and frequent use. The ear-shaped backrest adds a touch of cuteness and liveliness to the entire dog sofa.",
      "Easy to Clean - The leather has a certain degree of hydrophobicity, making this leather pet sofa easier to clean than the fabric version. Simply wipe the leather surface gently with a damp cloth to easily remove water stains, dog hair, odors, and other stains. The removable zipper design allows you to easily remove the entire sofa cover for cleaning and maintenance.",
      "Assembly - This pet sofa bed is shipped in a compact box; you only need to stuff the filling into the leather cover to complete the assembly. After waiting 24-48 hours, the high-density foam will fully expand to its maximum fluffiness. Patting and smoothing the sponge will make its filling more even and improve the overall appearance of the sofa."
