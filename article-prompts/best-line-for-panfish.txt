      "Highly Abrasion Resistant \u2013 The mono fishing line exhibits abrasion resistance that exceeds traditional copolymer monofilament and fluorocarbon by up to 2X. Better abrasion resistance allows you to fish heavy structure such as boat docks, submerged brush piles, and rocky bottoms with less concern over line failure. Higher abrasion resistance also equates to greater knot strength which means fewer lost fish due to knot failure.",
      "Low Stretch \u2013 TriPolymer Crappie Advanced Monofilament fishing line has a stretch factor that averages 12% lower than traditional copolymer monofilament. When fishing highly pressured crappie, the lower stretch allows you to feel even the slightest bite for immediate hook sets."
