      "Tile Choice: The single slope toward the linear drain opens up endless opportunities for tile choices while also minimizing grout lines. By eliminating the four-way slope in the shower pan, a linear drain allows tilers to create an uninterrupted flow from the overall bathroom to the shower with large format tile and solid surface materials.",
      "Maintenance: Linear drains can also extend the shower floor's square footage, promoting complete water evacuation in curbless enclosures. As a result, there is less chance of water pooling and running out under the shower door into the bathroom.",
      "Application: Linear drains are the ideal solution for creating ADA-compliant showers and wet spaces that are universally accessible. With only one slope and no barrier to cross, the floor more easily accommodates a freestanding bench, a wheelchair, or some other mobility aid."
