      "FEATURES: The aluminum (AL) body provides safety and durability. The bed cover panel consists of a standing seam AL slats system that provides seams that are virtually impenetrable to both knives and rain. The built-in cover lock makes it difficult to open the cover without permission. The cover's integrated sealing and drainage system keeps the bed and cargo sealed and dry in all-weather conditions, protecting against UV, dust, rain, snow, etc. This is true even when the truck is washed.",
      "HARDWARE: The cover panel is mainly made of aluminum slats, 2 aluminum side rails, and an aluminum canister with a built-in tension control of adjustment and drainage system.The aluminum canister is also used to store the slats when the cover is retracted.",
      "APPEARANCE: The aluminum body cover sits almost flush with your truck bed and can support up to 600 lbs of evenly distributed weight. The truck tonneau cover is dark matte powder-coated to protect it from rough scratches, marks, and corrosion. In case you accidentally open the pickup tonneau covers while driving, it will not affect safe driving unlike the tri-fold trucks tonneau cover. Furthermore, it will not obstruct the rear windshield sight after opening like the folding bed cover.",
      "EASY TO OPERATE: Open the lock, and the truck bed cover will automatically retract to the cabin along the side rail. You do not need to lower the tailgate, and our truck bed covers can be operated with one hand. There are no snaps to manipulate, no stuff to roll up or bundle and lash down, and no heavy tri-fold truck tonneau covers to lift and close.",
      "EASY TO INSTALL: Install through clamping. No drilling is required. The bed covers and tailgate will automatically lock when the cover is fully closed\uff08The cover must be fully open for the locking system to automatically transition to a locked state. In the event that it is only partially open, the locking system will be unlock until the pull strap is manually moved to the left.\uff09. In the open country, this cover is safer than a soft tarp."
