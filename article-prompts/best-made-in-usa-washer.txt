    "brand": "Wad-Free",
    "features": [
      "Wad-Free for Bed Sheets reduces the tangling, twisting, and balling-up of bed sheets in both the washing machine and the dryer. Drastically reduces wet items getting trapped in the sheets. Loads come out cleaner, helps the washer drum stay balanced, sheets dry faster with fewer wrinkles. Saves time and energy on laundry day.",
      "Works in all washers and dryers that amply fit your sheets. (Do not overstuff appliances. Compact appliances may not have ample room.) Reduces tangles on any size flat or fitted sheet. Safe for fabric and appliances following product and fabric care instructions. NOT FOR USE on fabric containing SILK or RAYON, which includes bamboo and eucalyptus; rayon goes by many names, including viscose, modal, lyocell, acetate, Tencel, and more. Please check your fabric content tags prior to use.",
      "Also suitable for tablecloths, pre-washing fabric yardage for sewing or crafting, pairing socks so they don't get lost, and stopping apron strings from tangling. Wad-Free also aids air-drying bedding, even if you don't have a clothesline: just wash with Wad-Free for cleaner sheets, then hang from the base indoors. Not intended for blankets or duvet covers; we also have a heavy-duty version available called Wad-Free for Blankets & Duvet Covers that is intended for those items.",
      "Instructions included & watch our How-to-Use video. Troubleshooting video available & our customer service can assist. Note 2 options for fitted sheets: the Standard Attachment Location at the elastic edge works for most, while the Alternate Corner Pocket Seam Attachment Location is used on thick or full elastic or deep pockets. Delicate wash cycle is best, NO high spin speed. Wad-Free has a high success rate, but every load has so many variables that it isn\u2019t 100% effective 100% of the time. Scroll down for full product details & instructions",
      "Each zip-lock package contains 2 assembled products, enough for 2 sheets, flat or fitted. One Wad-Free per sheet. Each sheet in the load must be attached to its own Wad-Free. The tabs may be stiff at first, but loosen after a few times through the wash. May not be manageable for people with arthritis and/or reduced finger/hand strength to use. Reusable. Makes great gifts! Made from custom-compounded US-sourced materials that tolerate the entire laundry process. Patented and Made in USA. Millions of sheets have been washed/dried with Wad-Free!"
