We make the mattress 2.67\" in the factory (it's the thickest we can make other wise the mattress will be too high to be stored in the sub trunk or in the frunk). When you receive it, it has been compressed in the bag for around 3-4 months. It will expand to this thickness after a week or so by not compressing it.",
