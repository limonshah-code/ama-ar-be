Suction technology firmly sticks to the floor without causing marks or damage, and the gripper easily peels off the floor. It is convenient to wash, as you won\u2019t have to separate it from your carpet for cleaning. The tape for rug adds extra comfort underfoot owing to the slightly bouncy nature of suction technology.",
      "Components. This package includes 12 pieces. The size of the gripper is 3.9inch x 3.9inch. Each piece is square in order to increase the surface area in contact with the floor.
