      "The Leading Name in Mattress Toppers: Viscosoft is consistently recognized for the highest quality memory foam and innovative fabrics, offering luxurious sleep solutions for every budget.",
      "A Better Way to Great Sleep in Your Dorm: Dorm mattresses are thin and uncomfortable\u2014far from ideal for restful sleep. Viscosoft's Hybrid Twin XL Mattress Topper is the ultimate upgrade for college beds. An innovative combination of cooling gel-infused memory foam coupled with a beautiful pillow-top cover transforms any dorm bed into a plush, supportive sleep surface.",
      "Cooler Sleep in Warm Dorms: Dorm rooms often lack temperature control, contributing to restless nights. The fabric in the Hybrid topper's cover offers superior breathability and moisture-wicking, keeping you cool and dry. Combined with gel-infused memory foam, this topper actively pulls heat away from the body, preventing overheating\u2014even in stuffy dorm rooms.",
      "Designed for College Life \u2013 Secure Fit & Easy Maintenance: The bed is a college dorm's comfort hub\u2014whether you\u2019re sleeping, studying, or lounging. The Viscosoft Hybrid Lux Twin XL topper stays securely in place with an 18-inch skirt and reinforced elastic, preventing slipping and bunching on dorm mattresses. No more constantly adjusting your topper\u2014just a snug, supportive fit that stays put. Plus, the removable, machine-washable cover makes keeping your sleep space clean nearly effortless.",
      "Trusted by Students & Parents \u2013 60-Day Risk-Free Sleep Satisfaction: Viscosoft is a USA-based brand that prioritizes customer satisfaction and quality. Backed by a 60-day money-back guarantee, parents and students can trust this investment to provide superior sleep throughout the college years and beyond.",
      "Move-in Ready \u2013 Quick & Easy Setup: Between unpacking, decorating, and meeting roommates, the last thing you need is a complicated setup. This Twin XL mattress topper arrives ready to use. The foam and pillow-top cover come in a single box, manageable for one person. Simply unroll the foam on your bed, anchor the pillow-top cover to the foam with the four corner straps, and secure it to your mattress with the elastic skirt.",
      "Better Than Cotton: Tencel. A Tencel fiber cover delivers a significant upgrade over ordinary cotton, offering superior breathability, moisture-wicking, and silky softness. Tencel naturally regulates temperature, keeping you cool and comfortable throughout the night, while also being gentle on skin.",
      "Durable, Long-Lasting Comfort \u2013 No Sagging or Flattening: Unlike entry-level mattress toppers that crater or compress, our memory foam and plush pillow-top layer ensure years of reliable comfort. Whether you use it every night for four years or store it between semesters, it maintains consistent support from move-in day to graduation.",
      "Personalized Sleep for Couples: For partners in a split king bed, the Viscosoft Hybrid Twin XL topper delivers customized comfort and stability for each sleeper. The premium memory foam has a medium-firm feel, absorbs motion to reduce nighttime disturbances, and is cut from a single-block of foam to ensure consistent support without sinking or gaps between mattresses. Unlike toppers that use concave (scooped) designs, which compromise stability, the foam in this topper creates a uniform sleep surface, so both partners can rest comfortably and undisturbed."
