      "Effective and Innovative - The PATENT PENDING Meliusly Sleeper Shield enhances the comfort of any pullout sofa bed.

It is specifically sized at 54 x 64 inches, ideal for queen-size sofa beds. Please note that the board only needs to cover the black canvas. It is not supposed to sit on the springs or the metal construction",
      "New and Improved - this newest version of our popular sleeper support board allows for the board to be permanently installed. You install it once underneath the mattress and it folds away with the sofa bed structure when the sofa bed is collapsed. No need to remove and store it away.",
