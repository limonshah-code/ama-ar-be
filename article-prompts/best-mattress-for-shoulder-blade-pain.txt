      "Deep Trigger-Point Pressure for Stubborn Muscle Tightness. This manual deep-tissue tool delivers stronger, more focused pressure than massage balls or rollers. Its angular curves and elevated nodes reach deeply seated trigger points in the shoulder blade, upper back, levator scapulae, QL, hip flexors, and pelvic muscles\u2014ideal for chronic tightness that requires elbow-like precision.",
      "Myofascial Release Based on Professional Therapeutic Techniques. The structure follows bony landmarks and muscle fiber directions, allowing users to replicate therapist-style pressure at home. The peak point mimics a therapist\u2019s elbow to melt stubborn knots under the scapula, around the shoulder blade, and throughout the mid-back, glutes, and psoas. Designed for lying, seated, or side-lying positions for targeted release.",
      "Aluminum-Alloy Core Wrapped in Food-Grade Silicone. Built with a reinforced aluminum-alloy core for strength and stability, this massager maintains precise angles even under full body weight. The silicone exterior provides a firm yet comfortable surface, distributes pressure evenly, and offers exceptional durability for long-term, heavy-duty use.",
      "Relieves Pain Linked to Posture, Athletics, and Deep Muscle Tension. Targets trigger points responsible for scapular pain, upper-back stiffness, levator tightness, hip-flexor strain, psoas discomfort, and pelvic imbalance. Supports improved mobility, shoulder-hip alignment, and functional movement patterns. Especially helpful for athletes, active individuals, and people with long-standing muscular tightness who need deeper pressure than traditional massagers can provide.",
      "Body-Weight Controlled Pressure With a Natural Learning Curve. Because it relies entirely on body weight, early sessions may feel intense until the muscles adapt. Short, gradual use is recommended while adjusting angle, position, or adding a towel for cushioning. Unlike vibration massagers, it provides steady, focused pressure for deep myofascial release. Best for users who prefer firm, therapist-like pressure. Backed by a 15-year warranty."
