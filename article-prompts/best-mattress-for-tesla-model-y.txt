      "The support. If air is introduced as part of the support, either it needs to be filled very hard (which is basically the method of Tesla mattress) Or the pressure point support is not enough due to the movement of air, which is easy to feel the floor. Compared with inflatable mattresses, people are more accustomed to and prefer the feeling of sponge mattresses. The surface has a soft depression, and the bottom has enough support, which is why we choose sponge",
      "Slope. There is a 3.2in drop when the rear seats are folded down, and the sponge thickness needs to be larger than the drop to eliminate the feeling of slope. After our testing, 4.5in is the best thickness, which does not occupy vertical space and can be compressed and placed in the front and rear of the car",
      "Size. The sleeping space in the car is very precious. We extended the width of the mattress to the armrest position, and the hands can be placed on the armrest position, which is equivalent to an extra 6in. The length of the sponge reaches 78in, and people with a height of 6'5\" can sleep on it without sagging their heads. The overall size is close to a queen size bed",
      "Storage. We have built-in bidirectional vacuum compression device, which can automatically exhaust all air in just 60s, just like a household compression bag, compressing the sponge volume to the extreme. After folding, it can be easily stored in the storage bag and placed in the front and rear trunk. Even female car owners can easily store it well, eliminating the need to find an external pump and manually exhaust air in the past",
      "Installation. Rotate the pump switch to \u201crecover\u201d, and the sponge structure can be automatically restored within 60s without any additional operations. 5-Year Peace of Mind: We stand by our mattress. Covered for core defects like seam splits, foam collapse, or pump failure under normal use. Our support team is here if needed. Tip: Store compressed when not in use for extended life (especially in high altitudes).",
      "Taste. The interior space is so small that even a little bit of odor is obvious. TPU fabric is safer and odorless. Even if it is exposed to the sun for a long time or not used, it will not harden, leak air, or emit irritating odors. The sponge has undergone odor dissipation treatment.",
