      "The DCOOLAULTRA hybrid mattress features an advanced multi-layer design with four distinct foam layers. A combination of gel memory foam and comfort foam helps evenly distribute pressure while gently contouring to your body. As the mattress responds to your weight, the underlying support layers provide a slightly firmer feel, creating a balanced and comfortable sleep surface that supports you throughout the night.",
      "The mattress features a finely woven, breathable fabric that promotes airflow and helps release heat and moisture from the surface, keeping you comfortable throughout the night. Inside, the increased foam layering and egg-crate foam design create multiple air channels that support continuous ventilation, reducing heat buildup and helping maintain a cooler sleep environment.",
      "The DCOOLAULTRA hybrid mattress is built with resilient materials, combining reinforced coils with added lumbar foam to deliver consistent, responsive support. This design helps limit excessive sink in the hips and lower back, supporting natural spinal alignment. By reducing pressure in key areas, the mattress promotes a more comfortable and supported sleep experience night after night.",
      "The mattress core is built with an individually pocketed coil system, where each spring is wrapped in its own fabric pocket to move independently. This design helps reduce motion transfer across the surface, so movement on one side is less likely to disturb the other. Reinforced edge support provides added stability, allowing you to comfortably use the full sleep surface with greater confidence.",
      "All memory foam used in this mattress is CertiPUR-US certified and independently tested for quality and safety. The mattress is backed by a 10-year limited warranty for added peace of mind. After unboxing, allow up to 72 hours for the mattress to fully expand and reach its intended shape. Please take care during setup and keep a safe distance while unwrapping, as the mattress may expand quickly.
