      "Avoid Excessive Force - When closing the zipper, if you feel sudden resistance, do not force it open with brute strength. This likely indicates the mattress has not been fully inserted into the bag, and the fabric has become caught in the zipper teeth. Instead, unzip a section, reposition the surrounding fabric, and gently try again. Never violently pull the zipper apart during use, as this can cause the surrounding stitching to break, leading to product damage."
