      "The DCOOLAULTRA hybrid mattress is designed with innovative materials, featuring four layers of different foams. The combination of gel memory foam and comfort foam helps distribute pressure and contour to your body. As you sink deeper into the mattress, the pressure-relieving foam becomes firmer, providing you with a unique sense of comfort.",
      "Highly breathable and cooling: The mattress is made with finely woven, breathable fabric that allows air to flow freely, effectively dissipating steam and sweat from the surface to keep your body comfortable and dry all night long. Additionally, the increased foam content and egg-crate foam structure, with its numerous breathable openings, enhance airflow throughout the mattress, preventing heat retention and ensuring you stay cool throughout the night.",
      "Enhanced Responsive Support: The DCOOLAULTRA hybrid mattress uses more elastic materials, with enhanced coils and additional lumbar foam working together to provide stronger support. This helps prevent the hips and lower back from sinking, keeping the spine in proper alignment. It offers extra pressure relief, assisting in alleviating back pain every night.",
      "Zero Motion Transfer, No Disturbance: The core of the mattress features the most advanced pocket spring system, with each spring encased in its own fabric pocket to prevent tangling. This design ensures zero motion transfer, so whether you're sleeping alone or with a partner, you won\u2019t be disturbed. Reinforced edges allow you to enjoy every inch of the mattress without worrying about rolling off.",
      "Safe Materials and Worry-Free Warranty: All memory foam is CertiPUR-US certified and tested, and we offer a 10-year warranty. We recommend allowing your new mattress to fully expand within 72 hours. Please maintain a safe distance when unboxing, as the mattress may expand quickly and pose a risk.
