      "IMPORTANT NOTES - To ensure a stable connection, make sure the thermometer is within range of your device. Signal disruptions may occur if there are obstacles or if the thermometer is too far. For accurate readings, always fully insert the probe into the thickest part of the food. Shallow insertion can lead to inaccurate results and false alarms. If you're experiencing disconnections, check for interference from other devices and ensure your phone or Bluetooth-enabled device is within range.",
      "CARES FOR BATTERY - Low battery power can cause performance issues, such as random disconnects. To maintain stable performance, ensure the thermometer is charged, or replace the battery if needed. If the display turns off while docked, confirm that the thermometer is properly seated in the dock. The thermometer may enter sleep mode to conserve battery after prolonged inactivity, which is normal. For best results, avoid long periods of inactivity without checking or charging the device."
