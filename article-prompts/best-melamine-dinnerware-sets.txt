However, they will not break or chip like porcelain or ceramic and won't splinter like wood, making them a great option for everyday use.",

Wheat straw dishes have a smaller carbon footprint than reusable plastic plates and consume less energy than other materials without harming forests or altering natural ecosystems. Thank you for supporting an American small business."
