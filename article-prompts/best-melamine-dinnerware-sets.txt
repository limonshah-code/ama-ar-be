      "[ Upscale & Stylish Wheat Straw Dishes Set for 4 ] - We know it\u2019s hard to believe, but this dinnerware set IS NOT ceramic. Our products are made using a blend of wheat straw and non toxic, food safe polypropylene, which binds the natural materials together and makes them unbreakable and microwavable. Included are (4) 10.5\" dinner plates, (4) 7.5\" dessert plates, (4) 27 oz cereal bowls, and (4) 30 oz pasta bowls. Pairs perfectly with our Grow Forward cups sets!",

Our bowls and plates combine the nice look of classy dinnerware with the practicality of wheat straw materials.",
      "[ Dishwasher Safe & Microwave Safe ] - Fridge and freezer safe too!

However, they will not break or chip like porcelain or ceramic and won't splinter like wood, making them a great option for everyday use.",

Wheat straw dishes have a smaller carbon footprint than reusable plastic plates and consume less energy than other materials without harming forests or altering natural ecosystems. Thank you for supporting an American small business."
