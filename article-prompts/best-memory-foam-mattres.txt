      "\u3010Comprehensive Upgrade\u3011: In our previous generation of products, there might have been some issues with the structure of the internal memory foam, which led to some mattresses not fully expanding at the four corners during cold winters. This time, we have made a brand-new upgrade, optimizing and adjusting the thickness of each layer of memory foam. Such problems will no longer exist.",
