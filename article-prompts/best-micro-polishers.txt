      "[Detailing] This mini polisher addresses the drawback of standard polishers having larger pads. It includes 1-inch, 1.5-inch, and 2-inch pads for handling intricate details, and weighs only 1.72 pounds (with battery), making it ideal for working on detailed areas of a car.",
      "[All-in-One] Our polisher is equipped with both 5mm and 12mm eccentric shafts, as well as a straight shaft. You can switch between a straight polisher and an eccentric polisher by changing the central shaft. This allows you to use it as either a Rotary (RO) polisher or a Dual Action (DA) polisher, depending on your specific needs.",
      "[Pure Copper Motor] This cordless car polisher features a pure copper motor, delivering faster and more efficient polishing results. It offers stable speed control, low noise, and minimal vibration, making it easy for beginners to use.",
      "[Multi-speed settings] The speed is adjustable with 11 different levels,with RPM ranging from 2500 to 6000. The 0.5-level design allows for more precise speed selection. The wide range and precise adjustment make it easier and more accurate to set the desired speed.",
      "[Rechargeable] Our polisher is equipped with a 80W, 12V, 2.3Ah battery and a charger, providing stable power support for extended use. Each battery can sustain the highest speed for up to one hour, and it charges up to 80% within 30 minutes.",
      "[Application] This car buffing kit includes 24 polishing pads and 3 central shafts. The 12mm random orbital provides stronger polishing efficiency. The 5mm random orbital is suitable for wet grinding and achieving a mirror finish, effective for removing minor scratches, but requires more precise pressure control. The rotary operates smoothly and is ideal for quick scratch removal.",
      "[Warranty] We provide one-year warranty service. Do not hesitate to contact us if you have any doubts or queries."
