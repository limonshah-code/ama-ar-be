Unlike other ceramic companies, our glazes are lead free, meaning you will never have to worry about lead leaching into your system and making you sick. Since our glaze is all-natural, it tends to change color depending on the lighting. The color may be a tad different from what you see on your screen.",

For best results, don't microwave the lid. But the mug is 100% microwavable. Lid style may vary in 2022.",

The shape was designed to fit in the cup holder of any car, contain your favorite 14 oz beverage, and make you happy every day.",
