      "LEAD FREE ALL NATURAL GLAZE: We know that lead is a poison, but what some of us don't know is that it is in a lot of ceramic glazes, since there is no US regulation for lead in adult products. Unlike other ceramic companies, our glazes are lead free, meaning you will never have to worry about lead leaching into your system and making you sick. Since our glaze is all-natural, it tends to change color depending on the lighting. The color may be a tad different from what you see on your screen.",
      "SPLASH RESISTANT LID: Our lid has a silicone grip that's 2X's thicker for extra grip. The ring extends to make a smaller drinking hole which reduces spilling while drinking by 90%. The lid stays shut until you open it. No more lids that open accidentally and splash coffee in your new car. As always, the lid is dishwasher safe and BPA free. For best results, don't microwave the lid. But the mug is 100% microwavable. Lid style may vary in 2022.",
      "DOUBLE WALLED CERAMIC WITH 20% STRONGER PALADIN CLAY: Our mug has two walls meaning it won't burn your hands when you're holding it. The clay was refined and fired with you in mind. Only we have Paladin Clay which is 20% stronger than the competitors, giving you a stronger and more durable ceramic cup. The shape was designed to fit in the cup holder of any car, contain your favorite 14 oz beverage, and make you happy every day.",

Our objective is to help you hit pause, so we won\u2019t settle for anything you don\u2019t love. We\u2019re not happy unless you are."
