      "Uncoated Stainless Steel Material: This moka pot is made of stainless steel, and the interior of the lower pot has been finely polished without any coating, giving it a smooth and shiny appearance. With excellent heat conductivity and durability, it is not easy to be deformed or damaged, and can be used for a long time and repeatedly cleaned, greatly extending its service life. It also absorbs and transfers heat to the pot quickly and evenly, and is compatible with most stoves, ensuring that the coffee extraction process is efficient and stable",
      "Multiple Sizes: Our moka pots come in a variety of sizes to fit every scenario from personal solo use to family gatherings. Special Note: The number of cups shown on the product page is only a reference to the industry standard capacity, the actual amount of coffee made may vary slightly due to a number of factors, and is usually slightly less than the amount shown. Therefore, if you tend to make more than one cup of coffee or want to keep more extra, the large capacity moka pot will be ideal",
      "Cleaning and Maintenance: New coffee pots should be boiled in water at least three times before use, and internal parts such as filters and funnels can be cleaned directly in the dishwasher to save time. For the pot, we recommend hand washing with water to keep the pot shiny and prolong its life. After using the mocha pot, need to wait for cooling before cleaning, after cleaning need to dry in time, so as not to accumulate water in the pot to produce black substances",
      "Usage: First, pour the right amount of water into the bottom of the pot, pay attention not to exceed the safety valve; then, the ground coffee powder evenly spread in the funnel, pay attention not to compact the coffee powder; Finally, the mocha pot placed on the stove, with a small fire heating, when you hear the obvious \u201chissing\u201d sound, indicating that the extraction has been completed, coffee flows automatically into the cup, eliminating the need for traditional mocha pot pouring and making it more convenient to use",
      "Warm Prompt 1: In the process of using, please pay attention to control the heating time and fire size, in order to prevent dry burning caused by the pot body damage. Discoloration of the bottom of the moka pot after use is a normal phenomenon and does not affect its normal use. When heating over an open flame, please make sure that the flame does not directly touch and exceed the bottom of the lower pot to prevent excessive heat that may cause the upper pot and handle to melt, to ensure that you can safely enjoy every time you make coffee",
      "Warm Prompt 2: If water leaks out of the moka pot at the junction, it may be due to powder residue in the chute or the top and bottom pots not being fully tightened.To avoid this, before each use, please check the powder groove and the contact area of the gasket to make sure it is clean and free of coffee powder residue, and tighten the upper and lower pots"
