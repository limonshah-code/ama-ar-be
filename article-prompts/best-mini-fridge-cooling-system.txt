      "[Note] Firstly, When your fridge arrives, ensure it sits unplugged for 6-12 hours before use! Shipping can jostle it quite a bit, so this resting period allows the refrigerant to return to the compressor fully, aiding in cooling and extending the fridge\u2019s lifespan. Remember - give it time to rest! Secondly, to mitigate the effects of violent transportation, our refrigerator is covered with a protective film, please peel it off before use. Lastly, If you initiate a return request, we will provide a prepaid return label. Please do not return the item yourself, we are not responsible for any costs incurred."
