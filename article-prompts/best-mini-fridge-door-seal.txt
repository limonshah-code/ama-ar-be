      "[Measurement method]Please measure the length (cm), width (cm) of your original refrigerator/freezer door seal before payment; please take a photo to show your seal type and groove/guide; we manufacture the refrigerator door seal seamless frame based on the information you provide to ensure a perfect seal. The refrigerator/freezer door seal can be removed, cleaned and reused.",
      "[Sealing]With our seals, you can easily prevent warm air from entering the refrigerator; otherwise, sealing defects will lead to a sharp increase in energy costs and the interior of the refrigerator may become a breeding ground for dangerous mold.",
      "[Magnetic properties]The polarity (closing force) of the magnet may not appear immediately, which may take up to 24 hours; if the magnet does not attract immediately, place a heavy object (such as a bucket of water) against the closed door to increase pressure.",
      "[Installation instructions]Due to the large size of the seal, we will fold it for shipment for easy transportation, but it is very flexible; just soak it in 60-70 degree hot water for a few minutes, install it according to our installation instructions and it can be used normally.",
      "[Color]3 colors: black, gray, white. Different styles correspond to different colors, so the colors are random. Normally we will make new freezer door seals in the same colour as your original freezer door seals."
