      "[Product Usage Tips] 1. Don't overload. Overload may cause the motor to turn on overheating protection. 2. Balance the spinner to prevent it from losing balance, hitting the inner walls, stopping work. 3. If the machine doesn\u2019t drain, check that the water hose is not clogged or bent, which may prevent the spinner from working properly. 4. Make sure the drain height is less than 45 inches.",
      "[Overheat Protection] The motor has overheat protection and will automatically stop working when it reaches 275\u2109, which increases safety and extends the service life of the motor. The motor will work again after 20-30 minutes. The total time for the entire washing and rinsing process is recommended to be no more than 60 minutes. [Load Capacity] Washer: 18lbs. Dryer: 10lbs."
