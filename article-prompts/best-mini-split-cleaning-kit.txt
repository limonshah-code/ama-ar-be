The following reasons are based on real feedback from thousands of buyers of air conditioner cleaning covers, and the data and conclusions are obtained after thousands of actual uses. 1. The waterproof function of any style of air conditioner cover on the market is divided into two parts. The first is to prevent water from splashing onto the wall. 2. Prevent water from splashing onto the bottom. The surround design on the market cannot completely protect the walls around the air conditioner from getting wet",
      "The reason is that the air conditioner cover needs to be plugged very thoroughly to protect the wall, but often during the cleaning process, the weight of the water will cause the bag to sag. After the actual cleaning, the middle wall will be wet. The purpose of our product directly adopting a completely non-contact air conditioner design and a steel pipe support design is to match the waterproof membrane and professional waterproof cloth to directly solve your wall Wet troubles!
