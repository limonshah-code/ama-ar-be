      "[Quiet & Professional Installation]: Operating at just 32 dB(A), it runs nearly silently, ensuring it won't disrupt your daily routine.During installation, the line set must be properly evacuated and vacuumed.This system mandates professional installation - it's not a DIY mini split AC.Equipped with a bottom heating element, the outdoor unit prevents ice buildup during winter operation, ensuring efficient defrosting and reliable performance.Maximum Fuse Size is 25A.",
      "[Multi Zone Capacity]: This configuration is designed for spaces where not all indoor units are expected to operate at full power at the same time. If the total indoor capacity is higher than the outdoor unit\u2019s output, the system can still function properly, but cooling or heating performance may be slower when all zones are operating beyond capacity. For consistently high demand across all zones, a larger or multi-system setup is recommended."
