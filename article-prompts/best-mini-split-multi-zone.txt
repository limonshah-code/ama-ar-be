      "Long Distance Air Blowing and Multiple Room Use: With the ability to blow the cool or heated air farther than traditional AC units, this mini split system can efficiently cool your entire room with ease. A large drum-shaped impeller fan improves air circulation for comfortable cooling and heating while the dynamic balance reduces noise and extends the fan's lifespan. Independently control the temperature in each room, making it ideal for diverse comfort needs.",
      "Personalized Temperature Adjustment: Save on installation costs by controlling individual room temperatures instead of using a central air system. This flexible approach offers quiet operation, saving on additional expenses in duct installation or heat pump."
