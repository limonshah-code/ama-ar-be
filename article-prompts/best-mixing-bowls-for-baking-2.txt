      "ALL INCLUSIVE: Wildone mixing bowls set contains 5 piece stainless steel mixing bowls 5, 3, 2, 1.5, 0.63QT, which allows users to measure, mix, pour, and serve food all in one kitchen tool! They come with BPA free lids, 3 grater attachments, silicone non-slip bottoms and measurement marks",
      "DURABLE MATERIAL: Each bowl is made of premium grade stainless steel that designed to resist dents and rustproof. They feature a mirror finish inside and brushed finish outside, which are attractive as well as functional",
      "USEFUL ADD-ON: Airtight Lids that fit snugly to keep an airtight seal and keep food fresh, so this set can be used as dry storage bowls with lids on. Besides, the plastic lid of the largest bowl has a removable centre. In here, one of 3 graters can be placed in case you need to grate something",
      "EASY MEASURE & NON-SLIP: Quarts and liters are clearly engraved inside the bowls and fade proof, meet the demand of different measurement. A silicone non-slip bottom keeps the stainless bowls steady on counter tops when beating and whisking. You can mix, beat, or whisk ingredients with little mess as the wide, deep bowls have high walls to prevent splatter",
      "EASY CLEAN: Convenient to use and even easier to clean. These bowls can be cleaned easily by hand with water and soap or in the dishwasher. But lids and graters are hand-wash only, because using the dishwasher would deform them. The bowls are safe in refrigerator, and freezer & preheat oven"
