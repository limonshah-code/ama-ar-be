      "Note: The Moka pot has good thermal conductivity. When using it, be sure to control the flame size and brewing time to prevent overheating and burning the bottom. The color change that occurs at the bottom of the pot is a normal phenomenon. Generally, it takes 3-5 minutes to brew. When you hear a noticeable sputtering sound, this indicates that the extraction is complete. At this point, immediately remove the Moka pot from the heat source to avoid dry burning and damage to the bottom."
