      "Multi-functional Utility Valve: Drain at the base makes it possible to empty the canister and perform seamless water changes by draining and refilling water directly from it. Convenient lid-mounted hosing clips offer clean storage when not in use.",
      "4-Stage Filtration: Four removable filter baskets eliminate water bypass and hold up to 1 US Gal (3.9 L) of media: mechanical, chemical, and biological. These baskets enable you to stack in the precise combination that will work best for your aquarium.",
      "Compact and Quiet Design: FX2 canister filter is 16.5\" (42 cm) tall, is 15% smaller than the FX4, and fits under most aquariums. Unidirectional impeller has fewer mechanical joints for reduced noise. Rubber feet reduce vibration and add stability."
