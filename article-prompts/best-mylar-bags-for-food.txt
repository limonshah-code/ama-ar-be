      "HOMEMADE SURVIVAL MEALS - Wallaby MRE bags allow you to assemble and store your own meals ready-to-eat. Avoid unhealthy additives and high costs of pre-packaged MRE or survival food kits and build your own instead. Includes bags and oxygen absorbers.",
      "WITHSTANDS BOILING WATER - Quality Mylar bags engineered to safely withstand boiling hot water. When ready to consume the contents, open, pour in boiling water, and cook or reconstitute dry goods, Harvest Right freeze dried, or dehydrated meals.",
      "PERFECT FOR BACKPACKING - Fill the MRE bags with lightweight dry foods like oatmeal and dried fruit, pasta, soup mix, quick cooking rice and spices, and add boiling water to cook when you reach your campsite. Enjoy your meal straight from the bag!",
      "MAXIMUM PROTECTION - An added internal layer of aluminum provides superior durability and puncture resistance to keep air and moisture out and the food inside fresh. BPA-free, food-grade Mylar is heat sealable above the zipper to lock out air.",
      "NOTE: Bags may NOT shrink like a vacuum bag when the oxygen has been removed. Absorbers do NOT absorb air; they absorb oxygen which is only 21% of the air. About 1/5 of the air volume will be gone, 4/5 remains no matter how many absorbers are used."
