It can provide continuous hot water for 2-3 water supply points, making it sufficient to meet the hot water needs of a household's bathroom, kitchen, and bar area.",
      "No Waiting Required: Unlike traditional tank water heaters, tankless water heaters eliminate the need for a 30-minute preheating wait time, allowing you to have unlimited hot water on demand.",
      "Provides 4 modes: Dish mode(100\u2109), Fruit mode(95\u2109), Elderly mode(104\u2109) and Infant mode(107\u2109). More convenient for you to use.",
      "Save Money: The kit already includes the exhaust pipe, so you don't need to spend extra money on purchasing it separately. With an oxygen-free copper water tank, it reduces heat loss and lowers energy consumption. Applied with standard 1/2\" NPT water fitting and gas inlet.",
      "Recommendation: We strongly advise that all installations of the device adhere to local building and plumbing regulations at the installation location, and should be carried out by licensed professionals.(Not recommended for areas over 2,000 feet)"
