      "What to Expect - This Pomade offers a different consistency than that of chemical-based products. It is important to understand that this product offers the most organic natural hold for a styling product on the market. No fillers or chemicals, just straight organic ingredients. In the event you receive a firmer than expected product, please note that using the back of your thumbnail to start the Pomade off will soften it over time. This Pomade is wax based.",
      "Ethical and Clean \u2013 Our Pomade incorporates rich Shea Butter to improve hair and scalp health. It contains essential fats, vitamins, and nutrients that moisturize the scalp, preventing dandruff and potential hair loss. A more natural way of providing hold than chemical based hair gel, this Pomade is malleable enough to style hair any way you like. Made with organic materials from around the world."
