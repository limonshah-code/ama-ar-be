      "DURABLE & PET FRIENDLY: Our entryway rugs are designed with your whole family in mind. Made of premium polyester cut-pile fabric with reinforced bound edges, they are much less likely to get caught on claws compared to loop-pile carpets or carpets with serged edges. This makes them an ideal choice for households with furry friends, keeping your floors clean and your pets comfortable with our durable, pet-friendly throw rugs and area rugs.",
      "EASY TO CLEAN: The stain and fade resistant polyester carpet surface can be easily clean by vacuuming. For a deeper clean, machine wash separately in cold water, using mild detergent. Tumble dry, no heat. Do not use bleach or fabric softener. Our door mat will not fade or wear out and will remain like new even after repeated washing."
