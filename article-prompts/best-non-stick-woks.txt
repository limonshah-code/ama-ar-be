Our carbon steel wok is no chemical coating and is pre-seasoned at high temperatures over 1000F using nitrogen treatment for excellent wear resistance, fatigue resistance, corrosion resistance and high temperature resistance.",
      "GENUINE TASTE: Our large wok pan reacts quickly to heat adjustments and is specially designed to lock the juice and flavor inside the ingredients.

The high curvature results in a broader base for maximum area of heat transfer, allowing the burner flames to visibly hug the pow wok.",

In addition to stir-frying, with the Todlabe cooking wok, you can cook healthy meals using various traditional cooking techniques like pan-frying, braising, and deep-frying.",
