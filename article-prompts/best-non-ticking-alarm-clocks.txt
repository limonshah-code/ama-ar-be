      "Gentle Ascending Beep Sounds: The alarm is loud enough, its volume will gradually increase from small to large. If you do not turn off the alarm, it will keep ringing for 40-45 minutes (every 5 minutes) until you turn off it. Great for heavy sleepers or who have trouble getting up.",
      "Battery Operated: This analog alarm clock operated by 1*AA battery(Not Included), light weigh and small, easy to operate and carry. It is a great small clock for you to travel or bring to everywhere. NOTE: Please use high-quality carbon batteries instead of strong alkaline batteries or rechargeable batteries to extend the service life of the movement (strong current will damage the movement and cause the time to be inaccurate)"
