This improves operational security and makes cutting easier.",

      "Peace of Mind: The double switch helps avoid accidental activation of the concrete saw when it's not in use, reducing the risk of injury. The machine also features slow start, overload protection, and built-in GFCI design, all of which ensure smoother and safer operation, as well as a longer lifespan.",
      "All in One Convenience: The concrete cutter comes with a wheeled base that doubles as a cutting and positioning device, making it easier to create precise grooves with less effort. It also features a generously sized handle that's ergonomically designed for a comfortable grip during long work hours.",
      "Cut through Anything: Our concrete cutter saw has a cutting depth of 6 inches, making it suitable for cutting through various concrete materials such as stones, reinforced concrete, pavings, and bricks.",
      "Note: It is recommended to perform cutting operations at 32A current. (When the current is 15A, the single cutting depth should not exceed 50mm (2\"). If a cut of greater than 50 mm (2\") is required make several passes)"
