The harder we press the button, the faster the liquid sprays out, the stronger the collision between the liquid and air, and the better the atomization effect. This is the working principle of all similar products. So when you feel that the atomization effect is not so good, please push the button a little harder. Please don't worry, still easy to do that. Second, please do not fill the oil more than 100ml, the remaining space needs to release the generated air pressure in order to provide better spray."
