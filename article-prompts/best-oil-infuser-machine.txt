With 6 preset cycles in addition to fully customizable time & temperature, it blends & heats your herbal butter, oil, or tincture infusion effortlessly. Cycles include: Decarboxylation, Butter, Oil, Tincture, Slow & Low, No Heat, and Self-Clean.",
      "All in 1, Decarboxylator & Infuser: Many herbal extractors, butter makers, oil infuser machines or gummy makers only infuse and do not decarboxylate. To get the full strength, your herbs must be heated properly. If you skip decarboxylation, your infusion product will be weak, only 10-25% activated. Decarboxylate up to 1 ounce. More efficient and effective than oven baking, butter churners, or crockpots.",

Make your own while selecting herbs and ingredients you trust that are free from harsh solvents, emulsifiers or additives. Unlike other machines, the Ediwhip uses the best quality premium stainless steel material keeping your infusions pure",
