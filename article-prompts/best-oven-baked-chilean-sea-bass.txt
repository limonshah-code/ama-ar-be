It is a deep water species, and technically not a member of the Bass family at all. This fish is caught in the cold, deep waters off the coast of Antarctica, and earned the name Chilean sea bass because Chile was the first country to bring it to the popular market, and \u201csea bass\u201d was deemed more commercially viable than \u201ctoothfish.\u201d",
