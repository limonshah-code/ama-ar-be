The second layer is made of ultra-high strength aramid fiber, known for its high temperature resistance and resistance to repeated use. The innermost layer adopts a knitted design, enhancing the comfort and breathability of the gloves, so you don't have to worry about the sticky feeling caused by sweat.

Our heat resistant gloves can hold for 10 seconds when the temperature reaches 800 degrees Celsius (1472 degrees Fahrenheit). Generally speaking, the higher the temperature of an object, the shorter the holding time. For example, you can safely hold a hot metal baking tray taken out of a 200 degree Fahrenheit oven for longer than holding a hot metal pizza tray taken out of a 500 degree Fahrenheit oven.

The BBQ gloves are equipped with an additional hanging rope design for easy hanging and drying after washing. Grilling gloves can be hand washed or machine washed. Basically suitable for everyone.",
      "\u3010Friendly Reminder\u3011Although our barbecue gloves have excellent heat resistance and flame retardancy, which can prolong the time you hold high-temperature objects, please note that all heat-resistant materials have their limitations. BBQ gloves don't provide permanent fire and insulation protection. Please avoid prolonged direct contact with open flames and high temperatures during use to prevent burns. These gloves are very useful and will become a regular part of your outdoor barbecue tools and accessories. I have confidence in the quality of our products. We offer a one-year warranty period. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us and we will solve them within 12 hours!"
