      "Keep your oven spotlessly clean with our non-stick copper oven liners! They catch drips, cheese, sauces, and other baked messes, making cleaning a breeze. Plus, you can wash them in the dishwasher for easy maintenance",
      "Customize the size and shape of your large oven liners to fit any oven or air fryer. Simply trim them to size or tile them together for larger ovens. They're perfect for all sizes of ovens and air fryers",
      "Not just for ovens! Our copper oven mats can also be used as pan liners, air fryer liners, grill mats, baking mats, cooking sheets, or gas stove protection pads. They're versatile and perfect for all your cooking needs",
      "Proper use and maintenance are key! For gas and electric ovens with a hidden heating element, place the oven drip mat at the lowest rack of the oven and not on the oven floor. For electric ovens with an exposed heating element, place them underneath the heating element at the bottom of the oven. Wash them with soap and water before using them for the very first time",
      "Cost-effective: An oven liner is an affordable way to extend the life of your oven and reduce cleaning time. Instead of spending money on expensive cleaning products or replacing your oven, you can invest in an oven liner that will protect your oven for years to come"
