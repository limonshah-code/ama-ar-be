      "BETTER RESULTS W/ UNIQUE PULSATING FEATURE: Enerzen's circuit board adjusts fan speed and ozone output throughout treatment, creating a \"pulsating\" effect. This aids in removing stubborn \"musty\" or imbedded odors and results in longer lasting treatments.",
      "GETS RID OF THE SMELLY BITS YOU CAN'T SCRUB AWAY: Ozone reacts with odors in the air, water, fabrics, and walls to remove, instead of mask them. Unlike other types of air purifiers, it does not require air passing through the machine to remove odors.",
      "COMMON USES: Deodorize cars, boats, dumpsters, kitchens, bathrooms, basements, flood and fire affected areas, as well as any cooking, smoking, pet, \"musty\", or general odors.",
      "EASY OPERATION: Turn the timer knob. Leave the space. When ozone generation is finished, allow an additional 30 minutes for any residual ozone to revert back to breathable air.",
      "WARNING: All ozone generators are meant to be operated in unoccupied spaces only. Remove any people, pets, or plants. The space may be re-occupied after 30 minutes of \"airing out\". Not available for sale in California. EPA Est. No.: 094263-CHN-001"
