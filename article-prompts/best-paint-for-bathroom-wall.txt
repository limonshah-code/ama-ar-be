The SENVEN Tub & Tile Refinishing Kit is here to reduce costs without breaking the bank on new fixtures or hiring a contractor",
      "HIGH-QUALITY TUB & TILE REFINISHING SPRAY PAINT: SENVEN tile spray paint offers superior abrasion and scratch resistance, making it ideal for high humidity environments. Its chip-resistant formula ensures excellent durability, even in hot water, and its strong finish resists peeling. SENVEN tile spray paint specifically engineered for these surfaces, it withstands moisture and extreme hot temperatures, ensuring a durable and corrosion-resistant finish",
      "EASY TO USE: SENVEN Tile Refinishing Spray Paint is incredibly convenient to apply. Simply activate the spray by shaking it well before use. It ensures a uniform spraying thickness, allowing for fast construction speed, a delicate paint film, and rapid drying. To enhance the adhesion of the coating, it is recommended to perform multiple uniform spraying layers",
      "HOW MANY CANS DO I NEED: 6 cans cover approximately 80-105 sq.ft.(with 2 light coats). Allow the first light coat to dry completely (wait about 10 minutes) before applying the second coat. 2 cans cover approximately 30-35 sq.ft.(with 2 light coats). Allow the first light coat to dry completely (wait about 10 minutes) before applying the second coat",
      "TIP FROM THE PROS: The tile spray paint formula dries to the touch in 20 minutes. Allow the surface to dry for 3 days prior to water exposure. The spray coating cures and becomes hard, like a semi-gloss porcelain finish, providing superior abrasion and scratch resistance. Please note that it has a strong odor. Therefore, please wear a respirator while applying, with the windows and doors open and fans running"
