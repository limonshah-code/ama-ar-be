      "EASY TO USE: SENVEN Tile Refinishing Spray Paint is incredibly convenient to apply. Simply activate the spray by shaking it well before use. It ensures a uniform spraying thickness, allowing for fast construction speed, a delicate paint film, and rapid drying. To enhance the adhesion of the coating, it is recommended to perform multiple uniform spraying layers",
      "HOW MANY CANS DO I NEED: 6 cans cover approximately 80-105 sq.ft.(with 2 light coats). Allow the first light coat to dry completely (wait about 10 minutes) before applying the second coat. 2 cans cover approximately 30-35 sq.ft.(with 2 light coats). Allow the first light coat to dry completely (wait about 10 minutes) before applying the second coat",
      "TIP FROM THE PROS: The tile spray paint formula dries to the touch in 20 minutes. Allow the surface to dry for 3 days prior to water exposure. The spray coating cures and becomes hard, like a semi-gloss porcelain finish, providing superior abrasion and scratch resistance. Please note that it has a strong odor. Therefore, please wear a respirator while applying, with the windows and doors open and fans running"
