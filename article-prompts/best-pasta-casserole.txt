It has a rougher surface, which helps the sauce stick to it. Since 1886 we have liked our pasta to be bronze drawn and slowly dried because we like it to fall into the plate full of taste, rough and always \"al dente\". Even though our taste has not changed, as we feel the same love for tradition, we have continued to improve our production technologies. Make de Cecco pasta the secret ingredient for your most amazing dishes.Buon Appetito! <p> Cavatappi (corkscrews) belong to the family of dried, whimsical shaped pasta with their tubular, curled or corkscrew shape. The double-ended opening and the distinctive ridges mean that this pasta is perfect with less dense, more liquid sauces, all of which are captured inside it. Cavatappi (corkscrews) are particularly suited for preparing plates of pasta served with dense, colourful sauces of meat or fish, with green leaf vegetables or vegetables, or strong cheeses. Try them when preparing delicious, colourful pasta salads. Available in 1 e 5 lb.",
