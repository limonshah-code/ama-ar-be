      "How to Buy the Right Size: Measure the internal dimensions of the air fryer basket before purchase; and ensure the width of silicone basket you chose shall be slightly shorter than that of air fryer basket; in that way, the silicone basket won't squeeze into a crease because it's big, and it won't be too small",
      "Measure Before Purchase: We strongly recommend that you measure the internal dimensions of the air fryer basket; the square silicone liner measures 9x9 inches wide at the top and approximately 8x8 inches wide at the bottom; fit a square-shaped air fryer and internal width of its basket is 9.1 to 9.9 inches",
      "Food Grade&Dishwasher Safe: The silicone pot is made of sturdy food-grade silicone, built-in handles and oven safe with heat resistant up to 428 \u2109; it helps with clean up and dishwasher safe; no sticky mess to the air fryer pan; no impact on food flavor",
      "Do with Caution: Do not place a silicone liner inside during preheat mode as heating element may cause smoke; leave the air fryer empty while preheating; it would get hot so be careful getting it out of air fryer, or use oven mitts or tongs to lift out",
      "Easy to Use: Silicone liner is a game changer for air fryers; after preheating, place a silicone liner and food in order; when cooking is done, pull the food out of air fryer basket (Let it cool before removing or using a pot holder as it does get hot)",
      "Save Time and Money: Reusable silicone liner is a must that saves you much time and money on cleanup; no more having to scrape baked-on food off air fryer basket and save coating on basket after roasting, cooking, or any serving food occasions"
