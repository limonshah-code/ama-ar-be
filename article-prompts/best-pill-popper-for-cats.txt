      "This cat pill shooter comes with two silicone soft tips. One of the tips has cracks, so the tip can be opened to clamp the pill. (don't use the cracks to clamp pills, please use the 2 sides of the silicone tip to clamp pills). Another tip has no cracks and can be used for feeding water or liquid medicine. (If the crack is not large enough to clamp the pill, you can use scissors to enlarge the crack. The tip for liquid feeding can also be cut cracks to feed the pill.) This product does not have a spring device, so the pill will not pop out quickly, but will be pushed out.",
      "Made of high quality silica gel, reusable and washable. Product size: 5.9x1.97inches. Product weight: 1.06 ounce. Especially for feeding solid medicines, pills, capsules to pets. (It's suitable for size of pill between 0.15-0.4 inches.)",
      "NOTE: 1.The soft tip must be completely sleeved on the top, ensure that it will not fall off during normal use. 2.Ensure that the tip and injection tube are in the same straight line, so that the push rod can smoothly impact on pill and push it out. 3.Do not stick the soft tips into pet's throat to prevent the tips from getting stuck in the throat. The correct use is to put the soft tip to the posterior position of tongue, then use the push rod to push out the pill and let the pet swallow it by himself. 4.Do not stuff the pill tightly into the soft tip, avoiding the pill not being able to be pushed out or the soft tip falling off with the pill. Gently clamping it is correct.",
