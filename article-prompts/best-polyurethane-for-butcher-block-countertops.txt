      "48x25 INCH COUNTERTOP - The 25\" depth is the standard for most kitchen countertops. Can also be used on top of washer and dryers or for tables. All our butcher blocks are a true 1.5 inch thick.",
      "GRADE A MAPLE - Big Bison Blocks uses clear, premium maple that is guaranteed to be knot free on the visibible side of your butcher block countertop. Our hard rock maple is properly seasoned and milled to prevent cupping and warping.",
      "FOOD SAFE FINISH - After joining, our countertops are finished with a NSF mineral oil based finish that is safe for food contact. No varnishes or polyurethane are used. This ensures our countertops can be used for food surfaces and cut on directly if wanted.",
      "KNOTS GUARANTEE - On the visible tops and sides, we offer a knot free guarantee. To keep our pricing competitive, there will often be knots on the underside (non-visible) of the countertop. Most customers are ok with this since the underside is usually not visible, but if you require completely knot free countertops, we unfortuantely are not the right choice.",
      "AMERICAN MADE - Big Bison Blocks of Redmond proudly produces all of our butcher blocks in America, using 100% responsibly harvested North American hard rock maple."
