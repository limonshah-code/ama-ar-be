After grinding, tap the bottom of the OX with moderate force to help release coffee grounds stuck at the exit due to static.",
      "[Important Cleaning Tips] - Always clean with a brush after each use; for best results, grind 1\u20132g of coffee beans before use to clean the interior; never wash with water to avoid damaging the circuit board."
