      "SAFETY IS THE FIRST PRIORITY: 1000W Water Heater is designed to keep the current within the safe value of 10A, which is essential for home use. 2000W or even higher power water heaters are very dangerous in case of unstable voltage. Typically, plugs in American homes can only carry 10-15A of current, so it is very safe to limit the current to 10A or less. To ensure optimal safety, use a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlet",
      "SAFETY IS STILL THE FIRST PRIORITY: The heating tube is embedded in a one-piece aluminum casting structure, which avoids direct contact between the heating tube and water, thus avoiding danger. At the same time, the aluminum casting structure increases the heat distribution area, making the water temperature rise faster and more efficient",
      "SAFETY IS ALWAYS THE FIRST PRIORITY: Teflon paint is applied to the outer layer of the cast aluminum structure. Impurities in the water will not be adsorbed on the Water heater, which can lead to uneven heat dissipation and damage to the heat tube",
      "ADJUSTABLE WATER TEMPERATURE: You can set the predetermined temperature of the water by using the buttons on the control box. The operation is very simple and easy to understand, safe and reliable",
      "2 MODES & PROGRAMMABLE: 1, Spa Mode - The default temperature is 108\u2109; 2, Heat Mode - The default temperature is 158\u2109. Choose different models according to your own needs. For example, you can choose Spa mode for bathing and Heat mode for outdoor cooking"
