      "\u3010Battery Capacity Explanation\u3011The battery capacity refers to the total energy stored in the power bank's internal battery. The rated capacity indicates the actual usable output capacity of the portable charger. The rated capacity of a power bank is typically slightly lower than its battery capacity. This difference arises from energy losses (approximately 30%-45%) during two-stage voltage conversion (e.g., 3.7V to 5V for device charging) and circuit inefficiencies. Such energy reduction is normal and meets industry standards. Please note that the capacity mentioned on the product page is the battery capacity."
