      "THE ULTIMATE TABLE SAW PUSH BLOCK - Most woodworkers already have multiple tablesaw push blocks in their toolbox. The thing is, most push blocks use a foam base to try and grip the wood or material to help feed it through jointers, router table cutters or band saw blades. The firm, slick foam tends to slip after a use or two and especially on harder or more dense materials. That material typically dry rots over time and renders the blocks useless.",
      "SUPERIOR GRIPPING POWER - Gator Grip push blocks for woodworking have a uniquely designed podular patterned rubber pad that offers superior gripping power over your standard foam base push block. The podular pattern along with the firm but receptive rubber material grips your stock better than ever before and makes feeding your stock through multiple workshop machine cutter types much easier. The unique Gator Grip podular design also helps keep dust and debris in the surface voids to help maintain excellent traction.",
      "PUSH BLOCKS FOR TABLE SAW AND MUCH MORE - While standard push blocks work, these push blocks take the next step in gripping power to give you superior control over your typical push block for table saw. With its unique offset podular patterned, non-slip rubber surface the Gator Grip push blocks help your control your wood, composite, metal and resin materials. Perfect for use on a router table, jointer, shaper, band saw or where ever you need to guide your stock through a cutter or blade.",
      "KEEP YOUR FINGERS SAFE - Not only does the Gator Grip push block for table saw grip better but it's specifically designed to help keep your fingers away from sharp, fast moving cutters and blades with its durable plastic body and thick raised handle. This in combination with the Gator Grip podular pads give you unmatched control of your workpiece.",
      "WIDE BASE FOR MORE GRIPPING SURFACE - With the 6-3/8\u201d long by 3-1/4\u201d wide base, you\u2019ll have plenty of gripping surface to work with large and smaller stock pieces. The comfort grip, molded handle is perfectly angled to make applying downward and inward pressure easy and with much less strain than you may have to exert with straight handled push blocks."
