      "\u2705 Get Lasting Leg Cramps Relief: Low magnesium is a major cause of leg and muscle cramps, but most people don't get enough from their diet to replace what they lose daily through normal living. Cheap drug-store magnesium supplements don't absorb well, have unpleasant side effects, and come bulked with unnecessary fillers and binders.",
      "\u2705 Our Unique Leg Cramps Pills: Cramp Defense is the solution. It is the original magnesium supplement for leg cramps and muscle cramps, since 2011. There are many magnesium products out there, but only Cramp Defense contains Truemag, a special magnesium compound that is organic, fully-reacted, triple-milled, AND in capsule form. All of these four factors help maximize absorption and minimize side effects. Here's why:",
      "1. Magnesium can be either organic or inorganic form. Organic forms are bound to an organic molecule, like malate. This is how nature always \"packages\" magnesium in fruits and vegetables, meaning our bodies are used to this form. Inorganic forms are like magnesium oxide, which are manufactured by pulverizing and purifying what are essentially rocks that come out of mines. Our bodies aren't made to absorb and handle this.",
      "2. Fully-reacted means the magnesium molecule is fully chemically-bound, which is a more energy intensive and expensive process that other companies don't use. Unbound magnesium tends to cause digestive upset, which is why a fully-bound product is so helpful. You can test if your magnesium product is fully bound by it's taste. It should be neutral, not bitter, salty or acidic.",
      "3. Triple-milled. Our product is milled three times before encapsulation, to reduce the particle size. This allows it to absorb faster and easier in the stomach.",
      "4. Capsules vs. tablets. Capsules just contain powder; tablets are hard, with extra binding components to hold it together, and are coated. This means capsules are faster and easier for your body to absorb.",
      "\u2705 Cramp Defense starts working immediately and gets better with time, as your magnesium levels are restored. Take the smallest dose which works for you, which for most people is 1-2 capsules per day. Our data shows that it works for about 80% of people; some people have cramps caused by other factors. Even if you don't have cramps, it is the highest quality magnesium supplement on the market, for general health."
