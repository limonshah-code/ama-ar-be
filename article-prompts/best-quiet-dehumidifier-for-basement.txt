      "\u3010Large-Capacity Dehumidification for Homes up to 3500 sq.ft\u3011Designed for spacious homes and demanding humidity conditions, Aeocky Boreas delivers reliable, lab-tested performance. It removes up to 50 pints per day in hot, humid environments (95\u2109, 95% RH) and 38 pints per day in warm, damp basements (86\u2109, 80% RH). Suitable for bedrooms, bathrooms, offices, basements, and whole-home use.(Dehumidification capacity is not the same as water tank volume.)",
      "\u3010Energy Efficiency That Matters Over Time\u3011With higher energy efficiency than many less optimized models, Boreas can significantly reduce power consumption during continuous use. Based on 24/7 use, its efficiency advantage can translate to up to 50% less energy usage, helping save up to 276 in annual electricity costs. When choosing a dehumidifier, it\u2019s important to consider long-term electricity expenses along with performance and upfront cost.",
      "\u3010Designed for a Quieter Home Environment\u3011Boreas features an advanced sound-control structure with vibration isolation to reduce noise transfer. Its dual-chamber airflow layout helps smooth air movement and limit pulse noise. At the lowest fan setting, sound levels are as low as 40 dB, comparable to soft background noise. Even at higher output, it remains quieter than many comparable units at their lowest setting (typically above 50 dB). (Size: 13.19\"L \u00d7 8.66\"W \u00d7 17.99\"H | Weight: 25.35 lb)",

      "\u3010Performance in Cooler Conditions\u3011Many compressor dehumidifiers struggle or stop working when temperatures drop below 65\u2109. Boreas features a frost-proof coated evaporator and advanced defrost sensors, allowing consistent humidity reduction at temperatures as low as 42\u2109. This makes it suitable for maintaining a comfortable indoor environment year-round.",
