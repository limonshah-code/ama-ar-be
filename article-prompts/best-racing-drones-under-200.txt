To calibrate: place the drone on a level surface, push both controller sticks down and outward (left joystick \u2199 bottom-left, right joystick \u2198 bottom-right) and hold for 2 seconds.

If you want to connect your phone to the drone, here's how to do it right: First, make sure the controller is completely powered off. Then start up the drone itself and connect your phone to its WiFi network. Once you're connected, open the drone app on your phone \u2013 that'll get the live video feed working. Only after you've got the video stream should you finally power up the remote controller to establish the control link.",
      "\u3010First flight tips\u3011:Due to drone operational complexity, thoroughly review the user manual before takeoff, and choose a windless open area, keep the altitude below 30 ft and the distance below 100 ft to help better practice and control the drone.Just so you know, the K13 is designed as a beginner drone, so it doesn't come with GPS or auto-return features. That means you'll need to keep a close eye on your signal bars and avoid pushing its range limits(328 ft)."
