      "[Authoritative Certifications] Dedicated to providing pure and healthy drinking water, Waterdrop, a world-famous water purification brand, has been trusted by over 6 million American families. Waterdrop's high-quality replacement filters, from every component to the whole filter, have been certified by NSF and IAPMO against NSF/ANSI 401, 53, 42, and 372 standards for effective reduction of 35 substances, ensuring high-quality drinking water.",
      "[Comprehensive Certifications] This filter has been strictly certified against NSF/ANSI 401 for reduction of 99.2% of bisphenol A , phenytoin, estrone, ibuprofen and naproxen and against NSF/ANSI 53 for reduction of 99.6% of lead, 96.6% of benzene and 92.3% of mercury. It is certified by IAPMO for reduction of 20 harmful substances like 99.59% of ethylbenzene, over 99% of trimethoprim, 2,4 D, Lindane, MTBE and atrazine. Furthermore, it can reduce PFOA and PFOS according to testing.",
      "[Deep filtration] Waterdrop's refrigerator filters significantly reduce the levels of many different harmful substances in your water, including a 95.3% reduction in PFOA and PFOS tested by the third-party laboratory. Moreover, the filter additionally allows through many of the beneficial minerals in water that are essential for health.",
      "[Fast water flow, no leaks] Our mission is to supply refrigerator filters that fit perfectly, impeccably engineered; this sets us apart from inferior models of replacement filters that can frequently result in water leakage problems. The microscopic pore sizes in our filter cartridges, made of superior materials, allow for smooth running, crisp, pure water.",
      "[Carefully chosen materials] Waterdrop uses coconut shell carbon blocks supplied from Sri Lanka that have enlarged surface area and more micropores than inferior carbon blocks. The filter cartridge is far more effective in reducing levels of chlorine, dirt, sediment, rust, and a wide range of heavy metals tested by a third-party laboratory. We have chosen a BPA-free and food-grade housing for the filter that exceeds the NSF 372 certification for lead-free filtration.",
      "[Regular filter changes] If you run replacement filter past the recommended date, impurities could accumulate and filtration performance could suffer. Because of this, we supply a complimentary set of installation stickers with every filter so that you can see at a glance when it needs replacing. We recommend that you should replace your filter after it has been used for 4800 cups of water (300 gallons) or 6 months (this may vary dependent on the water condition in your area).",
      "[Professional standards] Our expert teams pride themselves on not letting any product or part of a product, down to the smallest components, leave our factory unless we are satisfied that they have reached and exceeded the very highest market standards. Our dedication doesn't just apply within the factory: we have a customer service team ready to answer your questions and deal with any problems 24/7.",
      "[More than just a business] Waterdrop is passionate about providing clean water for as many people as possible with lower environmental impact. We use cowhide corrugated box packaging, reducing the wastage other companies create with their materials. A percentage of the purchase price from every one of our filters is used to fund projects providing clean, pure water for African children who don't have access to safe water supplies.",
