We recommend using lava rock as a filler if you have a deep fireplace or firepit. For a complete design, add fire glass on top to cover the fire rock thoroughly so it will not be detectable.",
      "FOR FIRE PIT, FIRE BOWL OR FIREPLACE: Because lava rock is economical, it is the perfect choice as the first filler that goes into a very large and/or dept fire feature to cover up the gas piping and tubes. Once the lava rock is spread the way you want it, add a layer of fire glass to create a truly astonishing design that will instantly become the focal point of your home or yard.",
      "LONG-LASTING: Lava rocks are volcanic so they can withstand the most extreme temperatures without any change in shape. They offer durability and provide a low maintenance and cost-effective natural element that looks great as part of your indoor or outdoor decor. They can be used with liquid propane or natural gas.",
      "GORGEOUS & PRACTICAL: It does a great job of covering the floor of a fire feature, effectively hiding the unseemly pipes and tubes which are often visible in gas fireplaces or fire pits. This makes lava rock a more preferable alternative to the more common ceramic logs and fire stones. It can also be used in planters, landscaping, ponds and gardening.",
      "QUALITY ASSURED: We sift, sort and pack all of our lava rock by hand. This way we can guarantee that they are top quality, can be used in a firepit. For optimal results, our recommendation is to pour a minimum of two inches of lava rock over the firepit burner, which allows the gas to filter evenly through the lava rock media."
