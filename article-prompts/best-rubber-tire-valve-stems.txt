      "\u3010Ease of Installation\u3011: Installation involves removing the old valve stem (if applicable), pushing the new valve stem into the rim hole, and ensuring it fits snugly, which can usually be done manually. The installation can be completed with standard hand tools or even by hand, making it accessible for vehicle owners.",
