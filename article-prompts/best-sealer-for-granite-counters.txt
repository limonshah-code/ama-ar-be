It works miracles on grout to guard against stains that develop between your shower or bath tiles that can be the most difficult to remove with just a sponge, no matter how hard you scrub.",
      "Do the Water Test - The best test to see if your granite needs to be sealed is to put drops of water in certain sections of your granite and wait 30 minutes. If the granite absorbs the water, you need to reseal. If not, your granite is protected. However, we still recommend using the Granite Sealer at least once a month to prevent stains from happening in the future.",
