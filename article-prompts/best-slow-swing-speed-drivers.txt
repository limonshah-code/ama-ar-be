      "[Speed Measurement] - Range of speed measurement from 20 MPH to over 200 MPH. Speed drives more distance. For every 1 mph gain an average of 1 to 2 yards distance is gained.",
      "[Batteries Not Included] - Powered by 3 AA batteries (not included); ideal for both players and coaches/instructors. NOTE: Refer the Manual before use.",
      "[Works With Most Swing Speed Trainers] - Works with the Stack System, RypStick, SuperSpeed Stick and other popular swing trainers. Combine this with a trainer, clubs and irons to increase speed and get more yards. It may be necessary to elevate the Swing Speed Radar up to 8 inches off the ground as the use of swing trainers tends to shorten the viewing plane of the doppler radar. The swing plane of the base of the swing trainer must be level with the Swing Speed Radar.",
      "[Doppler Radar Technology] - This Swing Speed Radar utilizes Doppler radar technology to measure swing speed. While highly accurate in controlled environments, the readings can be susceptible to interference from microwave and radio frequency (RF) waves. Flourescent lights, wifi signals, cell phone signals can all cause irratic readings. For optimal results, we recommend using the Swing Speed Radar in an environment free from the above-mentioned sources of interference."
