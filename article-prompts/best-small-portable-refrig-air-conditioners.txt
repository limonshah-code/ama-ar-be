      "\u3010Multi-Function\u3011Small cooling fans can be used as normal fans, humidifiers(add cold water) and mini Air Conditioner(add cold water and ice cubes), you can choose the fan function according to your needs. 7-color lights create a dreamy ambience at night (can be turned off), and the max operating noise is only 55 dB, which is very quiet.",
      "\u3010Dual Ultrasonic Atomizer Cooling\u3011The mini air conditioner is equipped with upper and lower water tanks. The upper water tank is equipped with a powerful dual ultrasonic atomizer, which can generate tiny water particles in the air, absorb the surrounding heat and dissipate it into the air; at the same time, the lower water tank can collect the atomized condensed water to prevent the condensed water from flowing out.",
      "\u3010Remote Control and Touchpad Control\u3011The portable AC supports remote control and touch panel control. You can use the remote control or touch panel to turn on/off the fan, adjust 3 types of wind speed, and set the timing time (2H-4H-8H). You can also turn on/off the water mist function (High and Low) and night light function (7 Colors) according to personal preference.",

Before use, just pour cold water and ice cubes into the top water tank, plug in the power, and enjoy 6-8 hours of humidification time (the cooling temperature depends on wind speed, room temperature, and humidity).
