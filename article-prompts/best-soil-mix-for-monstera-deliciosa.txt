      "Handpicked: The pine bark, perlite in the mixture are carefully selected by hand, the pine bark is uniform in size, the sphagnum moss debris is dry, clean and free from mud or other unnatural impurities, the perlite is manually selected to remove dust and small particles.",
      "It's a small package 7.8 inches x 5.9 inches x 0.74 inches",
      "Note: Although the mixture contains a moderate amount of balanced granular fertiliser with Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium, you will still need occasional supplemental fertiliser during the growing season."
