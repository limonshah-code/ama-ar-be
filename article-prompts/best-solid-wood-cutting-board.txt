      "REASONS for CHOOSING SAPELE WOOD: This wood comes from a type of African hardwood, which is hard and more durable than other woods, while being dense enough to be thicker and more subdued. Thanks to its wavy and random interlocking grain structure, sapele is a closed-grain wood that is less likely to absorb moisture than plastic, acacia wood etc. Thus less likely to warp and crack, and more durable",

The cutting boards are finely sanded and polished, with a smooth and comfortable surface.

      "THE LAST PROCESS: First through 491 \u00b0 F high temperature heating and baking, the excess moisture and grease in the wood baked out, so that the wood sweat rate of 12%. After that, the wood is cooled and cured at low temperature to balance the moisture content inside the wood. After the above process a layer of mineral oil is pre-applied to the surface of the chopping board to block water vapor from entering the wood fiber, making the wood more stable and crack-proof",

After washing, lean it against a standing wall board to dry naturally. The double silicone feet prevent slipping, and the bottom of the board has a drainage gap to prevent water from pooling.
