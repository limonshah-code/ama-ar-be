To enhance the adhesion of the coating, it is recommended to perform multiple uniform spraying layers",

Allow the first light coat to dry completely (wait about 10 minutes) before applying the second coat. 2 cans cover approximately 30-35 sq.ft.(with 2 light coats).

      "TIP FROM THE PROS: The tile spray paint formula dries to the touch in 20 minutes. Allow the surface to dry for 3 days prior to water exposure. The spray coating cures and becomes hard, like a semi-gloss porcelain finish, providing superior abrasion and scratch resistance. Please note that it has a strong odor. Therefore, please wear a respirator while applying, with the windows and doors open and fans running"
