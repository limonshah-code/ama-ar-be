In the flash settings, set the flash sync setting to \"M\", and the flash will fire in manual mode\uff1b2. If this still doesn't work, it might be due to the wrong shutter type.

The flash + fill light function has been added(in flash mode, a constant light auxiliary focusing light is provided). The SL03 flash provides 90\u00b0 flash angle adjustment. When you are indoors with white walls or ceilings, mini flash can reflect the light from the flash, thereby dispersing the light and making the shadow transition softer, ensuring the brightness of the photo while avoiding overexposure and whitening of objects in front of the lens.

As a mini flash is a single-contact flash, ensure the camera's shutter speed does not exceed 1/250s for optimal results. If your photo is white or overexposed, lower the flash brightness, or adjust other camera parameters, lowering ISO, exposure compensation, and using a small aperture.",
