To ensure the utmost safety and hygiene, it is recommended to run a piece of dough repeatedly through the rollers before the first use, as this will remove any residual protective grease.",
      "THICKNESS ADJUSTABLE---The thickness of the dough sheet can be easily adjusted by turning the machine knob, which offers 9 levels of thickness ranging from 0.5mm to 3mm, with level 9 being the thinnest. For perfect pasta dough, we recommend setting the thickness below level 5. On the other hand, levels above 6 are suitable for making dumpling wrappers, wonton wrappers, and other similar dishes. However, if the dough sheet is too thin, when cutting the noodles, it may fail to cut through properly.",

With its powerful 135W motor, the machine operates with minimal noise, ensuring a comfortable working environment. The stainless steel noodle maker is designed with rounded corners, ensuring safety and eliminating the risk of accidental finger scratches.
