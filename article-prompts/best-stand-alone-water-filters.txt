      "Energy Saving - Relying on the principle of gravity filtration, no electricity is needed. The gravity water filter system is divided into upper and lower chambers. The upper chamber can be filled with unfiltered tap water, the lower chamber will get clean water after filtered. Because it does not require electricity, it can be used indoors and outdoors. NOTICE: When the bottom chamber is full of filtered water, please do not add tap water to the top chamber or it will leak out.",
