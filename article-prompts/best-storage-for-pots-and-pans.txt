      "[Expandable Width] This cabinet storage rack features a reinforced pipe interlocking design, allowing the rack's width to be extended along the pipes. The maximum width can be extended up to 31.89 inches, with the rack dimensions being (27.28-31.89)\" W x 9.73\u201c D x 16.54\u201d H. It is recommended that the extended width be less than 30.3 inches. If the width exceeds this, the interlocking sections between the pipes become smaller, and placing heavy items may cause the entire rack to become unstable.",
      "[Adjustable height] The sturdy metal frame on both sides has seven screw holes, allowing you to adjust the installation height of the extendable track according to the space differences in different usage environments! The foot pads of the shelf can also be rotated and adjusted!",
      "[Upgraded Pot Rack] The pot rack features 7 adjustable dividers, allowing you to customize the spacing to accommodate pots of varying depths! The dividers are designed with concave grooves to securely hold pot lids in place, while the front and rear grooves can grip the handles of frying pans, ensuring organized storage! The bottom of the pot rack features an optimized grid design, preventing small items from falling out, and can accommodate the storage needs of frying pans, pot lids, lunch boxes, lunch box lids, and cutting boards!",
      "[Durable and sturdy] The entire rack is made of thickened carbon steel material, which is rust-resistant and has high load-bearing capacity. After installation, all screws must be tightened to make the rack more sturdy and durable! All components are upgraded and thickened for flexible disassembly and use.",
      "[Important Note] It is essential to clearly understand the product dimensions and the height of the adjustable tracks. Measure the actual height of the cabinet's interior space. If the height is too low, the height of items placed at the top will be restricted! If your cabinet is a closed-door type, the interior depth must be greater than the shelf depth plus the length of the pot handle; otherwise, it will affect the closure of the cabinet door!",
      "[Professional after-sales service] Please feel free to purchase! NETEL always strives to provide excellent service and high-quality products! If you encounter any problems during installation or use, please contact us at any time, and we will provide you with a satisfactory solution!"
