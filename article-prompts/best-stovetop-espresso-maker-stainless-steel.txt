The actual amount of coffee produced may vary depending on factors such as the amount of water added, coffee powder, personal taste preferences, and cup size, and will usually be slightly lower than the number of cups shown.Therefore 2 Cup/4 Cup would be too small, so we recommend that you purchase 6 Cup/9 Cup/12 Cup"
