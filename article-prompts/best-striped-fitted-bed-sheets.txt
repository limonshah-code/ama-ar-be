We're committed to your safety and comfort, which is why our 500-thread-count fitted sheets are rigorously tested to meet the highest performance standards. We meticulously inspect our fabric for pilling, shrinkage, strength, guaranteeing a high-quality product. Sourced from long-staple cotton, our gentle and soft sheets are STANDARD 100 by OEKO-TEX certified.",
      "These top-tier fitted sheets are skillfully crafted to withstand pilling, fading, and shrinkage, enduring robustness and aesthetic appeal. The extra-long staple cotton yarns minimize loose fibers, even after repeated washes. To achieve optimal results, machine wash at room temperature and tumble dry low to enhance softness. Being 100% pure cotton, these sheets might show slight creasing or wrinkling if left in the dryer for too long. Our sheets are manufactured without dyes."
