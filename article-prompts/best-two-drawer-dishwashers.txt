This hose is available from Home Depot (search for \u201cPVC Disposal Discharge Hose\u201d). When installing this hose, make sure that there is no sagging or loops. Any sagging will create standing water and will restrict the proper draining of the air gap. Secure both ends of the hose with a 1-inch stainless steel worm clamp.",
