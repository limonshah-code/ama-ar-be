      "PROTECT YOUR TILE INSTALLATION: Rather than tiling directly onto your substrate, lay down a floor membrane between your substrate and your tile. Whatever inevitable changes happen to your substrate, whether conditions cause it to expand, contract, or crack, this crack prevention membrane \"uncouples\" your tile floor from it, preventing damage from cascading upwards to it.",
      "EASY TO INSTALL: It's as simple as laying down thin-set onto your substrate, putting the membrane onto the thin-set, then continuing with your normal tile installation right on top of the membrane. Not only is your day of installation minimally changed, but barely any thickness has been added to your overall flooring.",
      "STOPS CRACKS FROM APPEARING: Wood and concrete substrate expands and contracts with temperature changes, which adversely affects brittle and rigid tile until it cracks. An antifracture membrane protects tiling from both, as it cushions and stops upward cracking while keeping the motion of expansion and contraction isolated and away from your tiles.",
      "PROTECT YOUR SUBSTRATE: Not just for protecting tiles but it also protects your substrate. Our decoupling membrane is waterproof, which is perfect for keeping water and moisture from seeping through your tiles and doing water damage to your substrate.",
      "FOR BOTH CONTRACTORS AND HOMEOWNERS: So easy, anybody can use this underlayment membrane for their own applications. Homeowners will have no problem installing it for their home flooring projects and contractors can keep it on hand to protect all their jobs and make their clients happy. 3.3 ft x 98.5 ft for use throughout your project."
