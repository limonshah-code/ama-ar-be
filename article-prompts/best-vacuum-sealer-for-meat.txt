      "Q1. Can this vacuum sealer work with vacuum sealer bags from other brands? A1. Yes. Our VS5166 vacuum sealer is compatible with any textured/embossed vacuum sealer bags from other brands. However, we recommend using name-brand or Gasbye bags, as some low-cost bags are very thin and may be punctured by frozen foods, which can lead to air leaks",
      "Q2. Can this vacuum sealer work with reusable zipper bags? A2. No, we do not recommend using reusable zipper bags for two reasons. First, from a food safety perspective, reusable bags that have previously held food can harbor bacteria, which may not be fully removed through routine cleaning and may build up over time. Second, they are not cost-effective.
