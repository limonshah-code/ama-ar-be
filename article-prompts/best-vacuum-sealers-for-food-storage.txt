      "Q1. Can this vacuum sealer work with vacuum sealer bags from other brands? A1. Yes. The VS5166 vacuum sealer is compatible with any textured/embossed vacuum sealer bags from other brands. For best results, we recommend using name-brand or Gasbye vacuum sealer bags. Some low-cost bags may be thinner and more prone to punctures from frozen or sharp foods, which can lead to air leaks over time",
      "Q2. Can this vacuum sealer work with reusable zipper bags? A2. We do not recommend using reusable zipper bags for two main reasons. First, from a food safety perspective, reusable bags that have previously held food may retain bacteria that is difficult to fully remove through routine cleaning, especially over repeated use. Second, they are not cost-effective. A pack of 30 reusable zipper bags typically costs over $30 (more than $1 per bag), while Gasbye 200-count precut bags (ASIN: B0FLXGHDH9) are priced at $22, or about $0.11 per bag"
