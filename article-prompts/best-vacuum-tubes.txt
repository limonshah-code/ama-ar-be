      "For JAN 5654W tubes, water-based silk-screen printing was used for final tube-markings; the green-color print may be faded or partially missing due to the age of the tubes (the manufacture of 5654W tubes ended approx. 35 years ago). Determing the authenticity of a 5654W tube is realtively straightforward, as both \"5654\" and \"USA\" were etched into the glass during the manufacture process (this can be seen in one of the listing images). The final green-color print was used to denote additional details such, including \"JAN 5654W\", \"Made in USA\", factory logo, date-code and other tube specifications such as the \"JAN\" (Joint Army Navy) miltary-use designation."
