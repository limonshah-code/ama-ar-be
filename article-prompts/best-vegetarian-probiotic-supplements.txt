      "STABILITY AT ROOM TEMPERATURE - When it comes to probiotic products one of the major challenges is that many bacteria strains are very sensitive to heat and some even have to be refrigerated to preserve the bacterial integrity and quantity. The spore-forming Bacillus Coagulans strain used in our product does not have to be refrigerated and is very stable at room temperature. Soil-based, spore-forming, colonizing probiotics.",
      "HIGH SURVIVAL RATE IN ACIDITY - Not all strains of probiotics are considered valuable because only some of them are able to survive through the acidity of the stomach at high levels, survive in bile salts and, grow and form colonies in the intestines. The special soil-based Bacillus Coagulans strain used in our product -thanks to its very tough outer shell- is highly resilient to the harsh conditions of the digestive tract and has a high survival rate that enables it to colonize the gut.",
      "NOT GROWN ON DAIRY - Did you know that some so called \"dairy free\" probiotics are actually grown on dairy based growth medium? Our probiotic strain is grown on non-animal, non-dairy growth medium making it truly vegan.",
      "SUPPLEMENTED WITH PREBIOTICS - 100 mg of Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) are added to each capsule as prebiotics. This is a type of prebiotic that helps probiotics multiply and grow stronger in your gut.",
