      "RATIO - Every tube of Artists\u2019 Oil Paint contains a calculated ratio of oil and pigment based on the quantity of oil in the tube. This varies from colour to colour because, just as some pigments need to be ground finer than others, they also need more, or less, oil to provide optimal performance.",

Years from now, for your work to be seen as you intend it to be, your materials need to be lightfast (not fade from exposure to light) and permanent (not change over time). So that you can trust in the longevity of your work, our oil colours are tested for these qualities and have some of the best ratings (at least AA or A)."
