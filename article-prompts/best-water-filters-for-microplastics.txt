      "THE ONLY GRAVITY FILTER CERTIFIED TO REMOVE MICROPLASTICS, LEAD & TOTAL PFAS: Enjoy cleaner, safer water with our carbon and ceramic water filter certified to NSF/ANSI-42 standards to reduce harmful contaminants. Each gravity water filter reduces microplastics, lead and forever chemicals, while keeping in essential minerals like calcium and magnesium. Ceramic filters are not designed to reduce TDS (total dissolved solids), so TDS readings may stay the same or slightly rise while still giving you healthier, safer water.",
