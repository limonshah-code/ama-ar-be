      "The 60 PSI option is frequently utilized for under-sink RO systems with pressurized storage tanks. Since water is not needed on-demand as the storage tank is continually filling, this option is ideal. It offers sufficient pressure for the membrane while also being stable enough to prevent leaks.",
      "The 70 PSI option is an excellent choice if you have high pressure and want to restrict it to the optimal 70 psi, which is essential for the best performance of RO systems. Higher pressure is often employed for applications where water is required more frequently and on-demand."
