Use our portable softener as often as you\u2019d like to combat the struggle of dealing with hard water",
      "REMOVES WATER SMELL - Hard water is notorious for smelling like rotten eggs and having a foul taste. Improve the overall smell of the hard water at home by using a water softener. Because the softener prevents scale buildup and reduces the number of metals in the water you use daily for bathing, and washing your hands when they\u2019re dirty, the water will be fresher and without the odor"
