      "Wide 10-3/8\" base for maximum stability on uneven surfaces. High Flow ports for minimal pressure drop and 5 GPM flow. The 16,000 grain capacity will provide up to 40 days (2,000 gallons) of softened water depending on your hardness and usage. Additional female adapter included for backwash (WS-P-REG-KIT kit available for faster regeneration). Conditions Well or City water. Reduces Calcium, Magnesium, Iron, Lead, Radium and other Heavy Metals. Ready for use in 5 minutes!",
      "This Portable Softener & Conditioner produces twice the gallons compared to a standard model and offers the best value and is the best compact RV softener on the market measuring about 10\" x 19.5\" total size.",
      "Universal Regen Kit: The WS-P-REG-KIT is the first of its kind for portable water softener regeneration systems. Easy to use and comes with components to make regeneration a breeze. Quick-connect fittings and brine hose come standard with the kit. Compatible with any Portable Water Softener that utilizes \u00be\u201d garden hose fittings. Reduce regeneration time in half over the traditional method of pouring salt through a tiny hole.",
      "True Regeneration: Outdated methods of pouring in salt through a tiny hole only to regenerate the top layer of resin is over. PA-REG-KIT works like a mini-brine tank, similar to a regular whole house water softener system. Simply pour 1-2lbs of table salt into the empty housing, tighten, connect a garden hose, attach to a portable water softener, turn on the hose and allow a pencil-sized stream to come out. 30-45 minutes later, the resin is fully regenerated and ready to use once again.",
      "Compatible: 100% compatible with portable water softener brands that are equipped with universal \u00be\u201d garden hose fittings. Filter campground source water to provide clean, sediment/chlorine-free water. When combined with a Portable Water Softener, clean-filtered soft water is achieved. Can be used as a stand-alone pre-filter by simply connecting a garden hose to one end of the base and the other to the RV/trailer directly. The filter is easy to remove when the included wrench is used."
