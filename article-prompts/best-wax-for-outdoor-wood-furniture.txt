      "\ud83d\udcaf\u3010Natural Materials\u3011Our wood seasoning beeswax for furniture is made from natural beeswax and mixed with mineral oil according to traditional techniques. They are silicone-free, GMO-free, paraffin-free, non-toxic and environmentally friendly. Due to the properties of its natural materials, beeswax must be protected from light. Changes in the outside temperature cause deformation without affecting the use.",
      "\ud83d\udc1d\u3010Easy and Safe to Use\u3011Firstly ensure that the surface is free from dust and dirt. Apply the beeswax evenly to the surface of the wood using a sponge or soft cloth. Leave for about 15-30 minutes to allow the wood to absorb the oils in the beeswax. Then wipe off the excess with a clean, soft cloth. Allow the furniture to dry naturally: in a dry, ventilated area, it will take at least 2 hours and may take up to 24 hours to dry completely.",
