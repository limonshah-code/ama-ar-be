      "FILTER SCHEDULE: Depending on whole home usage and inlet water quality, filters 1-3 should be replaced every 6-12 months, or 100K gallons of water filtration. Our 1\" connection, and filters, allow for 0.25 gallons per second at 45-80 PSI.",
      "PLEASE NOTE: This 3-stage whole house water filtration system does NOT reduce TDS. If that is one of your desires, please consider one of our reverse osmosis systems - search \"Express Water RO5DX\" on Amazon."
