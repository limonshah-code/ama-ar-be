      "All in One Wireless Dog Fence & Training Collar: T810 Pro is a smart wireless dog fence system that also works as a dog shock collar with remote. In electric dog fence wireless mode, you can create a safe boundary up to 656FT radius (33\u2013656FT, 8 adjustable levels). If your dog crosses the perimeter, the dog fence collar will issue beep, vibration, or static correction. In dog training mode, control your dog up to 1100 yards away with Beep (1\u20138 levels), Vibration, and Static (1\u201316 levels). Ideal for daily training or outdoor freedom.",
      "Improved Stability with Real-World Use Considerations: This wireless dog fence system uses 2.4G dual-channel FSK communication to deliver reliable performance in typical home and outdoor environments. Compared with older systems, it helps reduce random triggering when properly set up. Like all wireless fence systems, signal strength and boundary range can be affected by walls, metal structures, terrain, and nearby electronic devices. This electric dog fence is designed to support safe, controlled training with proper setup and supervision. For best results, we recommend testing and adjusting the fence radius in your actual environment before regular use.",
      "Real-Time Dog Activity Display on TFT Screen: The dog electric fence collar detects your dog's activity\u2014lying, walking, running, or jumping\u2014and sends it instantly to the transmitter. The color TFT display shows live dog status, battery levels, and fence settings at a glance. With this perimeter dog collar system, you always know what your dog is doing, giving peace of mind when they play in the yard or during camping trips.",
      "Multi-Dog Support & Safe Training Features: One transmitter can pair with up to 3 collars, making it an effective wireless dog fence for 2 dogs or 3. Each collar can be selected individually for separate control and adjustment. A safety lock button prevents accidental shocks. The adjustable collar strap fits medium and large dogs comfortably, with short and long contact points plus silicone covers to suit different coat types. This wireless electric fence for dogs adapts easily to multi-dog households.",
      "Outdoor-Ready, Waterproof & Portable Design: The receiver is IPX7 waterproof, so it keeps working in rain, mud, or puddles. The transmitter includes a built-in compass, hanging clip, and LED flashlight (steady & strobe) for outdoor use. The collar also has an LED locator that flashes on command, helping you track your dog at night. Compact and easy to carry, this dog boundary collar system doubles as a portable electric fence for dogs, perfect for camping, RV trips, and outdoor training sessions.",
      "Type-C Charging & Practical Battery Performance: This dog perimeter collar wireless fence system uses Type-C charging for easy recharging. Charging time and battery life may vary based on usage, settings, and environment. In Fence Mode, power consumption increases depending on range and signal conditions, and plugging in the transmitter is recommended for extended use. In Training Mode, power use is lower when used intermittently. Designed to support both short-term containment and ongoing training with proper setup."
