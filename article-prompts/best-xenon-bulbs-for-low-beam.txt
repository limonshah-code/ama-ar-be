The intense white light produced by the Xenon HID lamps is comparable to daylight. Studies have demonstrated that xenon automotive lighting helps drivers to concentrate on the road and to distinguish obstacles and road signs much faster than traditional lamps. *Compared to standard halogen bulbs",

Philips quartz-glass bulbs (filament 2650\u00ba C and glass 800\u00ba C) are able to withstand severe thermal shock. With the capability of increased pressure inside the bulb, UV-quartz glass is able to produce a more powerful white light. Only a burning bulb made of quartz glass can resist thermal shocks. This can happen, for example, when a drop of cold water touches the hot headlight bulb as you drive through water with a broken headlight unit.",
