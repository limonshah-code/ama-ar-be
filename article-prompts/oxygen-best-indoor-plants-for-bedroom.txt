      "BOWSTRING EVERGREEN: Sansevieria Superba is a drought-tolerant perennial with sharp, dark green leaves year-round. Commonly known as Snake Plant or Devils Tongue Plant, this hardy succulent is composed of strong fibers that have been used to craft bowstrings for generations. As a houseplant, Superba is very easy to care for and delivers a strong statement through its undeniable aesthetic",

Tightly clustered rosette leaves grow upwards from the soil and are leathery in texture. Superba's compelling structure adds dimension to the indoors, grabbing attention wherever the plant is grown",
      "TWISTING VISION: Devil's Tongue Plant grows foliage that subtly twists and turns with development. This wave effect occurs naturally and creates a sense of motion in Superba's overall home decor presentation. Each succulent plant is shipped fully rooted in a starter snake plant pot. This indoor house plant is guaranteed a healthy delivery",

Superba is easy to grow and will tolerate drought and low light (not unalike other low light house plants). Live plants should be unpacked gently upon arrival. Each plant ships fully rooted in a 4 inch grow pot and is estimated to range from 4-6 inches tall (measured from the rim of the pot)"
