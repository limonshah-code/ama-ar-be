### FAQ Section

**Q1: How do robot vacuums handle pet hair on hardwood floors?**
A1: Robot vacuums designed for pet hair on hardwood floors typically feature strong suction power to lift loose fur and dander, often coupled with tangle-free or rubber brushes to prevent hair from getting wrapped and stuck. Their low profile allows them to reach under furniture where pet hair tends to accumulate, ensuring comprehensive cleaning without scratching delicate surfaces.

**Q2: Are self-emptying features worth it for pet owners with hardwood?**
A2: Absolutely. For pet owners, especially those with multiple shedding animals, self-emptying stations are incredibly valuable. They significantly reduce the frequency of manual bin emptying, often allowing for weeks of hands-free operation. This prevents contact with collected pet hair and dander, making the cleaning process much more hygienic and convenient.

**Q3: What features are essential for a Roomba on hardwood floors?**
A3: For hardwood floors, look for models with strong suction, soft or rubberized main brushes to prevent scratches, and advanced navigation systems (like LiDAR or precise sensors) that avoid bumping into furniture. Mopping capabilities are a bonus for tackling paw prints and sticky messes, while a low profile ensures thorough cleaning under furniture.

**Q4: Can robot vacuums scratch hardwood floors?**
A4: Most modern robot vacuums designed for hard surfaces are engineered to be gentle. They typically use soft wheels, rubberized components, and non-abrasive brushes to prevent scratching. However, it's always wise to ensure the model you choose explicitly states it's safe for hardwood and to keep its brushes clean from abrasive debris.

**Q5: How often should I run my Roomba for pet hair on hardwood?**
A5: For homes with pets, especially heavy shedders, running your robot vacuum daily or every other day is often ideal. This consistent cleaning schedule prevents pet hair from building up and spreading throughout your home, keeping your hardwood floors consistently clean and minimizing allergens.
